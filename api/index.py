This is the copyright and preface information for the eighth edition (1990) of "Lamb's Questions and Answers on the Marine Diesel Engine," by Stanley G. Christensen.  The book, originally authored by John Lamb in 1920, is a guide to marine diesel engines, based on reader questions and inquiries.

This text details the history and enduring relevance of a marine diesel engineering textbook originally authored by John Lamb in 1922.  The book, presented as a question-and-answer guide, has remained popular for its practical approach and has been continuously updated to reflect advancements in the field.  The preface highlights Lamb's collaboration with Cornelius Zulver, a pioneer in diesel engine technology, and emphasizes the book's continued use by students and professionals across various sectors where diesel engines are employed.  The text underscores the broad applications of diesel engines, from large ships to small vehicles and emergency power systems.

This 1989 text discusses advancements in marine diesel engines, focusing on the shift towards diesel-electric propulsion for improved fuel efficiency and reduced operating costs.  The adoption of diesel-electric systems, exemplified by the Queen Elizabeth II's conversion, is highlighted as a key development allowing for faster turnaround times and economic advantages.  The text also emphasizes the significant increase in fuel costs since the 1973 fuel crisis and the subsequent demand for engines with lower specific fuel consumption, achieved through advancements like high-efficiency turbochargers.

This text discusses the history and evolution of slow-speed diesel engines, focusing on the shift from cross-scavenged and loop-scavenged designs to the now-universal uniflow scavenging system pioneered by Burmeister and Wain.  The advantages of uniflow scavenging, namely lower fuel consumption, are highlighted, despite the added complexity of exhaust valves.  The text also notes the role of improved engineering tools, like finite element analysis, in reducing engine weight and cost while increasing reliability, and mentions the impact of changes in fuel quality on engine design.

This text discusses advancements in marine diesel engine technology, particularly concerning the use of low-quality heavy fuel oil.  Improvements include advanced fuel purification equipment (replacing older separators with self-cleaning clarifiers), better lubricating oil additives (now in solution, not emulsion), higher injection pressures allowing for lower cetane number fuels, and electronic engine controls.  The text also highlights the continued dominance of uniflow scavenged two-stroke engines in slow-speed applications and notes updates to the book itself, including added illustrations and revised questions to reflect current practices.

For fifty years, diesel engine builders debated cross/loop scavenging vs. uniflow scavenging, with the latter ultimately prevailing due to lower fuel consumption despite added complexity.  Burmeister & Wain, a leader in four-stroke engines, switched to uniflow scavenging in their two-stroke engines, highlighting the industry shift.  Modern slow-speed diesel engines are now highly standardized, benefiting from advancements like specialized hydraulic tools and finite element analysis, leading to lighter, more reliable designs.  However, the quality of available fuel has declined due to changes in oil refining processes.

This text describes advancements in marine fuel technology and engine design.  Improvements in fuel purification equipment (self-cleaning clarifiers) now efficiently handle low-quality, high-specific gravity fuels, replacing older separator technology.  Lubricant quality has dramatically improved due to advancements in additives, eliminating storage separation issues.  Medium-speed engines now utilize fuels with lower cetane numbers due to increased injection pressure and engine design changes, necessitating new ignition quality measurement methods.  Finally, the text notes the increased use of electronic speed control and fuel injection systems, and highlights updates to a book reflecting these advancements.

This text defines matter as anything that exists and occupies space, composed of molecules, which are themselves made of atoms.  Atoms contain a positively charged nucleus (protons and neutrons) and negatively charged electrons.  The number of protons determines the element, while the number of electrons determines its charge (ion). Isotopes of an element have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons.  Molecules can be monatomic (one atom), diatomic (two atoms), or triatomic (three atoms).  Substances are classified as elements (identical atoms), chemical compounds (different atoms), or chemical mixtures (molecules retaining their identity).

The text describes the three states of matter: solid, liquid, and gas, differentiating them based on intermolecular forces and resulting properties like shape retention, volume resistance, and elasticity.  Solids have strong cohesive forces and three elastic moduli; liquids have weaker forces, two moduli, and viscosity; gases have negligible cohesive forces, one modulus, and fill their containers.  Amorphous substances exist in an intermediate state.  The text also begins a definition section for basic physics terms (mass, force, velocity, etc.), providing units for mass and force as examples.

This text defines fundamental physics concepts relevant to engineering, including velocity, acceleration, work, energy (kinetic and potential), momentum, and power.  It also explains the concepts of moment of force, couple, torque, and twisting moment,  and differentiates between centripetal and centrifugal forces.  Units for each quantity are provided, with a focus on the joule (work and energy) and the watt (power).

The text defines three key concepts related to rotational motion:  Inertia resists changes in an object's motion; Moment of inertia is the sum of each mass particle multiplied by the square of its distance from the rotation axis; and Radius of gyration is the distance from the axis at which the entire mass can be considered concentrated for rotational calculations.

This text defines stress (force per unit area), strain (change in dimension/original dimension), and their types.  It explains elasticity (a material's ability to return to its original shape after stress removal) and isotropy (uniform properties in all directions).  The text details tensile, compressive, and shear stress, noting that shear stress involves a tangential force causing a change in shape and inducing both tensile and compressive stresses along diagonals. Finally, it defines Hooke's Law (stress proportional to strain within the elastic limit) and introduces Young's Modulus, shear modulus, bulk modulus, and Poisson's Ratio (though it doesn't define the latter three).

The text describes elastic limits and moduli of elasticity in materials.  It defines the elastic limit as the point beyond which permanent deformation occurs.  It then explains Young's modulus (stress/strain), shear modulus (shear stress/shear strain), and bulk modulus (compressive stress/volumetric strain). Finally, it introduces Poisson's ratio, the ratio of lateral strain to linear strain within the elastic limit.

This text discusses several concepts in materials science and engineering.  It defines Poisson's ratio, resilience (elastic strain energy), and differentiates between simple, fluctuating, alternating, and cyclic stresses, highlighting the importance of the latter three in relation to fatigue failure.  Finally, it explains stress raisers (notches) and how fillets can mitigate them.

Abrupt changes in a machine part's section create stress concentrations, particularly at corners and shoulders.  This is exacerbated by fluctuating stresses, leading to fatigue failure.  Properly designed fillets and tapers minimize this risk.  Material failure can also result from exceeding the yield point, causing permanent deformation and potentially fracture, or from brittle fracture, especially in welded components.  Engine part failure is defined as inability to perform its designed function, due to wear and tear or material breakdown.  Repairs involve replacement or reconditioning, with economic factors considered.  Investigations are crucial to identify and rectify causes of premature failure.

This text discusses fatigue failure in materials, particularly in the context of engine parts.  Fatigue failure, characterized by fracture after many stress cycles (high cycle fatigue) or fewer cycles (low cycle fatigue), occurs due to factors like material flaws, improper heat treatment, or poor machining.  The failure process involves slip between grain boundaries, crack initiation and propagation, ultimately leading to a characteristic fracture surface with both smooth (initial crack) and rough (final fracture) areas.  Engineers mitigate fatigue failure through careful design, considering stress concentrations at discontinuities (e.g., oil holes, fillets) and using appropriate safety factors in calculations.  The text also briefly mentions other failure modes like creep and brittle fracture.

This text discusses stress analysis in marine diesel engine design, focusing on stress concentration factors (SCF) and their calculation.  It explains how SCFs are used to determine allowable stress, noting the challenges in obtaining accurate SCF values and suggesting finite element analysis (FEA) as a computational solution.  The text also describes electron microscopes (SEM and TEM), their operation, and their applications in materials science, failure analysis (e.g., fatigue failure analysis), and the analysis of fuels and lubricants.

This text defines temperature as a measure of "hotness" determining heat transfer direction (higher to lower temperature until equilibrium), and heat as a form of energy from the kinetic energy of atoms and molecules.  It then describes the effects of heat on matter: increased kinetic energy, temperature rise, thermal expansion, and phase changes.  Latent heat of fusion is the heat required for solid-to-liquid phase change without temperature change, and latent heat of vaporization is the heat required for liquid-to-vapor phase change without temperature change. Finally, it defines sublimation (solid directly to vapor) and dissociation (heat breaking down molecules).

This text defines specific heat as the heat needed to raise a unit mass's temperature by one degree Celsius.  It differentiates between endothermic (heat-absorbing) and exothermic (heat-releasing) reactions.  Heat transfer methods are explained: conduction (through solids), convection (in fluids), and radiation (electromagnetic waves).  Finally, it describes the relationship between pressure, specific volume, and temperature of a perfect gas using Boyle's Law (PV=constant at constant temperature), Charles' Law (V proportional to T at constant pressure), and the combined gas law (PV=RT).

This text describes thermodynamic processes in internal combustion engines (constant pressure, constant volume, adiabatic) and then explains Avogadro's Law (equal volumes of gas at the same temperature and pressure contain equal numbers of molecules).  It details how Avogadro's Law is used to convert volumetric analysis of exhaust gases to weight-based analysis, primarily in engine development and fuel testing.  Finally, it defines a mole in both the SI system and engineering context, highlighting its use in fuel combustion and exhaust gas analysis.

This text explains the kinetic theory of gases (1.31), which describes gas molecule movement and its relation to pressure, temperature, and heat.  It then discusses theoretical air cycles (1.32) used in thermodynamic calculations to determine ideal engine efficiency.  However, real-world applications deviate from these theoretical models due to factors like imperfect gas behavior, combustion product contamination, heat transfer losses, and friction.  Engine designers use theoretical calculations as a starting point, refining them with practical testing to improve engine design.

Internal combustion engines (ICE) burn fuel inside the engine, typically in reciprocating cylinders (like piston engines) but also in rotary types (like gas turbines and Wankel engines).  Reciprocating ICEs are either spark-ignition (using gaseous or volatile fuels, operating on a modified Otto cycle) or compression-ignition (using liquid fuels, often operating on a dual-combustion cycle).  Compression-ignition engines, often called Diesel engines (though historically inaccurate),  require fuel, air for combustion, and a system to move air and fuel into the cylinders and exhaust products out.  Both two-stroke and four-stroke cycles are used in both spark-ignition and compression-ignition engines.

This text describes the four-stroke cycle of a marine diesel engine.  The cycle consists of four stages: intake (air enters the cylinder as the piston moves down), compression (the piston moves up, compressing the air), power (fuel is injected and burns, forcing the piston down), and exhaust (the piston moves up, expelling the exhaust gases).  The process utilizes the "ram effect" during intake and a "blow-down" period during exhaust to optimize efficiency.  Work is only produced during the power stroke; the other strokes represent a pumping loss.  Valve opening and closing are timed precisely using cams, with a delay between initial opening and fully open positions.

Two-stroke engines complete the power cycle in two piston strokes, unlike four-stroke engines.  Exhaust expulsion and air intake (scavenging) occur near bottom dead center, aided by low-pressure scavenge air.  The remaining cycle (compression, combustion, expansion) mirrors the four-stroke cycle.  Simple two-stroke engines use port timing controlled by piston movement; more advanced designs use non-return valves to improve scavenging efficiency and increase power output (by 8-20%).  The key difference between crosshead and trunk-piston engines lies in how transverse thrust is managed; crosshead engines use a piston rod, while trunk-piston engines do not.

Crosshead engines use a crosshead assembly (piston rod, slippers, guides) to manage the angularity of the connecting rod, transmitting transverse thrust (guide load) to the engine guides.  Trunk-piston engines simplify this, transmitting the thrust directly from the piston skirt to the cylinder wall.  Both designs convert reciprocating piston motion to the crankshaft's rotary motion and manage the forces generated.  Guide load includes static (cylinder pressure) and dynamic (inertia) components.

This text compares crosshead and trunk-piston marine diesel engines, and describes opposed-piston engines.  Crosshead engines offer higher power at lower speeds and lower lubrication costs due to better bearing design and crankcase isolation, but require more headroom and are more expensive to produce. Trunk-piston engines are cheaper and more compact but have limitations in high-power two-stroke applications. Opposed-piston engines, using two pistons in one cylinder, are always two-stroke and can have one or two crankshafts, offering various design variations with advantages and disadvantages not fully detailed in this excerpt.

Opposed-piston engines use pistons instead of side cranks, offering advantages in lighter weight and better balance due to the absence of firing loads transmitted to the bedplate.  However, they require more headroom than other engine types.

This text defines key terms related to internal combustion engines, specifically focusing on diesel engines.  It explains swept volume, clearance volume, compression ratio, volumetric efficiency, scavenge efficiency, and air charge ratio.  It differentiates between natural aspiration and supercharging (also called pressure-charging or turbocharging), highlighting the increased power output achieved through supercharging. Finally, it notes that engine designers consider cylinder dimensions and ambient temperature when selecting the compression ratio, with smaller engines and colder temperatures requiring higher ratios.

This text discusses diesel engine compression ratios for various applications (ship propulsion, generators, automobiles), noting that larger engines often utilize preheating for easier starting and reduced wear.  It then details three two-stroke engine scavenging methods: cross-scavenge (exhaust and scavenge ports opposite each other), loop-scavenge (exhaust ports above scavenge ports on the same side), and uniflow-scavenge (scavenge ports around the circumference, with an exhaust valve).  The text explains the airflow patterns for each method and notes the historical progression from cross-scavenge to loop-scavenge to uniflow-scavenge in slow-speed engines.

This text describes the scavenging process in internal combustion engines, focusing on the effects of stroke/bore ratio on cross- and loop-scavenged engines.  Increasing the stroke/bore ratio beyond optimal values (1.75 for loop, 2.00-2.20 for cross) hinders proper scavenging, leading to exhaust gas mixing with incoming air, reduced oxygen content, and ultimately lower engine output.  The text also compares cross-scavenged and uniflow-scavenged engines, noting the simplicity of cross-scavenged engines (lacking valves) but highlighting their drawbacks: complex port machining, reduced effective stroke, and increased liner wear.  Finally, it emphasizes that engine design involves balancing competing factors, such as efficiency and size.

Uniflow-scavenged engines, despite needing multiple exhaust valves (depending on engine size and speed), offer significant cost advantages over cross-scavenged engines.  Their cylindrical scavenge ports, arranged around the liner's circumference, result in longer effective piston strokes and cheaper cylinder liners with less wear, compared to cross-scavenged designs.

Uniflow-scavenged engines have superseded cross-scavenged engines because they offer higher thermal efficiency due to a larger stroke-bore ratio, leading to lower fuel consumption.  This is crucial for the economic viability of ships.  Cooling of cylinder heads, liners, and pistons is essential in diesel engines to prevent overheating, maintain structural integrity, and ensure lubrication.  Water or oil is used as a coolant, with careful control of flow to maintain uniform temperatures and prevent thermal stress. Modern engines, due to advancements in temperature monitoring and research, operate at significantly lower temperatures than their predecessors.

This text describes diesel engine cooling and combustion chamber design.  Small diesel engines are cooled by water (cylinders and covers) and/or air (fins on cylinders).  Combustion chamber shape (spheroid, inverted saucer) depends on piston and cylinder head design, aiming for even fuel spray distribution to avoid wasted "parasitic volume." High-speed engines often use pre-combustion chambers to manage rapid pressure rise, injecting fuel into a smaller chamber before it enters the main chamber as burning vapor.  Finally, fuel atomization is crucial for efficient combustion, maximizing surface area for heat absorption and oxygen access.

The text explains that efficient combustion in a diesel engine requires atomizing the fuel into tiny droplets.  Larger fuel particles have smaller surface areas, leading to slower heat absorption, oxygen starvation, and incomplete combustion.  Breaking the fuel into smaller particles drastically increases surface area, allowing for faster, more complete combustion.

This text discusses aspects of diesel engine operation.  It first calculates the fuel injection time (33 milliseconds) based on engine speed and fuel valve opening period.  It then explains diesel engine bearing lubrication, differentiating between fluid-film (hydrodynamic) lubrication where an oil film separates the bearing surfaces, and boundary lubrication where metal-to-metal contact occurs.  Finally, it describes how diesel engine valves are opened (by cams) and closed (by springs), detailing the forces involved in valve operation and the potential for feedback torque on the camshaft.

This text describes marine diesel engine mechanisms and maintenance.  It details a cam and roller valve mechanism, then outlines two main maintenance areas: combustion system maintenance (cleaning, part replacement) and bearing/alignment maintenance (lubrication, inspection). Finally, it lists characteristics used to classify marine diesel engines (stroke cycle, piston type, cylinder arrangement, speed, fuel type, crankshaft support, bedplate support).

This text discusses the characteristics of diesel engines used in different applications (marine propulsion and electrical generation) based on speed (slow, medium, high).  It details the typical engine speeds and characteristics for each application, noting the trade-offs between propeller efficiency and machinery weight.  Finally, it provides an example calculation of the maximum load on a slow-speed two-stroke diesel engine's cylinder cover and piston, and explains how these loads are transmitted through the engine structure.

This text describes a simulated marine diesel engine test rig used to measure stresses on engine components like tie-bolts, shafts, and frames under load.  It then explains fossil fuels, differentiating them from nuclear fuels, and specifies that diesel engines use gas oils and diesel oils derived from crude oil distillation.  The notes highlight calculations for gas load on cylinder cover studs and tie-bolt tension, as well as the storage requirements for liquefied petroleum gases.

Crude oil is classified into paraffinic, naphthenic, and asphaltic types, though many variations exist.  Refining involves heating crude oil to around 350°C and passing it through fractionating towers to separate components based on boiling points, yielding products like petroleum gases, petrol, and gas oil.  The residuum can be further processed to increase light constituent yield or, if suitable, used to produce lubricants through solvent and acid refining, removing unwanted constituents like waxes and impurities.

The text discusses the deterioration of marine diesel fuel quality, linking it to the competitive fossil fuel market and environmental regulations.  Rising crude oil prices in the 1970s forced refineries to compete with coal and natural gas, while lead-removal legislation impacted fuel production.  Refineries adapted by updating techniques like vacuum and catalytic/thermal cracking to increase yields of valuable fuels (e.g., unleaded gasoline) and reduce less valuable residues.  The processes, including details on catalytic cracking (using silica and alumina catalysts) and thermal cracking (including visbreaking), are briefly explained.  Catalyst fines (CC fines) are mentioned as a byproduct of catalytic cracking.

Modern oil refining practices, such as visbreaking and catalytic cracking, reduce the amount of residual fuel, concentrating impurities like sulfur, vanadium, and ash.  This, combined with blending residual and distillate fuels, leads to higher concentrations of these impurities and increased aromatics in marine diesel fuels.  This results in potential combustion problems and difficulties with fuel cleaning.  The text then lists various properties and tests used to specify and assess the quality of both distillate/blended fuels and lubricating oils for marine diesel engines.

This text discusses fuel and lubricant properties relevant to marine and diesel engine applications.  It explains that the flash point of a fuel, measured using a Pensky-Martens instrument, indicates safe storage temperature but not engine suitability.  The text then defines viscosity (resistance to flow), viscosity index (viscosity change with temperature), cloud point (wax crystallization temperature), and pour point (temperature at which flow ceases).  Finally, it mentions Newton's law of viscosity, which relates shear force to dynamic viscosity.

This text describes dynamic viscosity, its definition (shear stress/velocity gradient), and its measurement.  It explains that dynamic viscosity's SI unit is the pascal-second (Pa·s), also known as the poiseuille (Pl), while the poise (P) is a commonly used unit.  The text uses diagrams to illustrate the concept and a viscometer design based on Newton's law of viscosity.

This text describes methods for measuring the viscosity of liquids, focusing on viscometers.  It details the historical context, mentioning Poiseuille's work on capillary flow and Stokes' Law concerning falling spheres.  Different types of viscometers are discussed, including those using orifice flow time and falling ball methods.  The text defines dynamic and kinematic viscosity, their units (poise, stokes, centipoise, centistokes, m²/s), and their relationship.  Finally, it notes that the mathematical details are found in fluid mechanics texts.

The text describes kinematic viscosity (in centistokes, cSt) measurements of fuel oils at various temperatures (e.g., 40°C, 80°C, 100°C).  Distillate fuel viscosity is reported at 40°C, while residual fuel viscosity is reported at 80°C or 100°C.  Modern digital viscometers are mentioned.  Finally, the text begins to discuss improving pure mineral lubricating oils for diesel engines, noting that oils from different crude stocks have varying properties (e.g., specific gravity).

This text discusses the deterioration of marine diesel engine lubricating oils due to oxidation and high temperatures, leading to increased viscosity, sludge formation, and carbon build-up.  It details the use of various additives to counteract these problems: antioxidants to prevent oxidation, detergent-dispersants to prevent carbon build-up and sludge formation, extreme pressure (EP) additives to reduce wear, viscosity index improvers to maintain viscosity at high temperatures, pour point depressants to lower the pour point, and anti-foam agents to prevent foam formation.  The text highlights that paraffinic base lubricants generally require additives to achieve the performance levels needed for modern high-output engines.

High viscosity and carbon content in blended fuels lead to operational problems.  High viscosity, like high density, hinders centrifugal separator function, impacting water removal.  It also causes combustion issues and injection system failures due to high pressures. High pour points necessitate heating to prevent solidification, increasing steam demand and potentially requiring auxiliary boilers or generator shutdowns, negating cost savings from using cheaper fuel. High carbon residue causes combustion problems and buildup in engine components (valves, turbochargers, boilers, silencers). High asphalt content also contributes to engine problems (details not fully provided in the excerpt).

This text discusses the effects of various fuel contaminants on marine diesel engines.  High asphaltene content slows combustion and mimics the effects of high carbon residue. High sulfur content, while historically problematic, is mitigated by alkaline cylinder oils; however, low sulfur fuels can cause wear with some high-alkalinity lubricants.  Abrasive silica and alumina cause wear on fuel injection equipment, while sodium and vanadium, unable to be removed by centrifuging, cause corrosion, particularly affecting exhaust valves if temperatures aren't sufficiently low.  Finally, the text describes a titration method for testing lubricating oil alkalinity and acidity.

This text describes methods for determining the acidity (Total Acid Number, TAN) and basicity (Total Base Number, TBN) of lubricating oils.  While color indicators work for other substances, potentiometry—measuring voltage changes during titration—is necessary for accurate oil analysis.  The results, expressed as milligrams of reagent per gram of oil, require skilled interpretation of graphical data.  International standards (e.g., ANSI/ASTM D 664 and D 289) govern these testing procedures.

This text from a marine diesel engine manual discusses crankcase oil testing.  Testing frequency depends on engine type (crosshead vs. trunk-piston), with crosshead engines needing testing every three months unless there's a history of contamination.  Trunk-piston engine testing frequency depends on various factors (engine design, fuel type, filtration, etc.).  Spectrographic/spectrochemical analysis detects metallic substances indicating wear, while ferrographic analysis examines particle size and shape to pinpoint wear sources.  Both methods are primarily used for high-speed engines but can be applied to slow-speed engines. Finally, microbial degradation, or biodegradation, is explained as the decomposition of oil by microorganisms in the presence of water and favorable conditions.

Microbial degradation of lubricating oil can be detected by the production of sulfurous gases (rotten egg smell), yellowish film buildup, oil darkening, milky opacity, and the centrifuge's inability to separate water from the oil.  The additives in the oil may act as nutrients for the microbes causing this degradation.

Microbial degradation of fuel oil primarily affects distillate fuels in the presence of water, causing smells, clogged filters, slimy buildup, and sludge formation.  High-viscosity fuels are typically unaffected due to high temperatures during processing.  Prevention involves biocides/fungicides (used cautiously in lubricating oils) and preheating lubricating oil to 82.5°C during treatment.  SAE numbers classify oil viscosity.  Supplement and Series oils are high-detergency lubricants for trunk-piston engines, exceeding the detergency of untreated mineral oils.  Lubricating oil degradation manifests as bearing corrosion and surface breakdown.

Crosshead engine cylinder oils are used once and endure harsher conditions than trunk-piston engine oils due to continuous oil circulation in the latter.  Higher-quality cylinder oils for lower-grade fuels have increased detergency and alkalinity (higher Total Base Number, or TBN).  However, TBN isn't the sole indicator of cleaning effectiveness. Modern oil-soluble additives improve oil stability compared to older dispersion and emulsion types, which suffered from settling and water separation.  Finally, a separate section mentions Stokes' Law regarding sphere resistance in viscous fluids, but its relevance to fuel oil cleaning is not explained.

The text describes the separation of water from fuel oil, focusing on the factors affecting the velocity of water particles settling in a fuel.  The velocity is inversely proportional to viscosity and directly proportional to the difference in density between the water and the fuel.  Heating the fuel reduces viscosity and density, thus increasing the separation rate.  The separating force is defined as the difference between the mass of a water particle and the buoyant force acting on it.  Centrifugal separation (in purifiers/clarifiers) is also mentioned but not detailed.

The provided text describes a formula (f = (d/r) * g) calculating the separating force (f) between oil and water based on their densities (d1, d2), the radius (r) of equivalent spheres, and gravity (g).  It then explains that in a centrifugal separator, this force is multiplied by the centrifugal force, but there's a size limit to separable particles, depending on factors like throughput, viscosity, densities, rotational speed, and bowl design.  The centrifugal separating force is denoted as f<sub>K</sub>.

This text describes two types of fuel treatment equipment: coalescers and homogenizers.  Coalescers are multi-stage filters that separate water and solids from distillate fuels. They use progressively finer filters and specially treated paper to coalesce small water droplets into larger ones that can be easily removed. Homogenizers create stable, uniform mixtures (emulsions) from immiscible liquids or finely divided solids, such as breaking down large water particles in heavy fuel oil into a uniform distribution.  High-speed separator bowls (6000-7000 rpm) significantly increase separating force.

This text describes homogenization techniques (mechanical and acoustic agitation) and centrifugal separators for lubricating and fuel oils.  It contrasts batch and continuous treatment in centrifugal separators, noting that modern continuous treatment machines are self-cleaning.  Finally, it differentiates separators (with dam rings controlling oil/water separation) and clarifiers (lacking dam rings, retaining water and sludge until manual cleaning).  Dam rings regulate the oil-water interface, while sealing rings in clarifiers prevent water discharge.

This text describes self-cleaning centrifugal separators and clarifiers used in marine applications.  Separators, which may or may not have feed holes in their conical disc stacks (a blank disc is always at the bottom if holes exist), require initial water filling to seal against oil leakage. Clarifiers, conversely, don't need this initial water fill and act as a secondary filter for removing remaining contaminants, primarily after the oil has passed through separators.  The key difference between early self-cleaning separators and other types lies in their bowl design: self-cleaning bowls have sloped walls (W-shaped cross-section), allowing for easy cleaning by simply removing and spinning the bowl to eject sludge.  These machines were initially used for lubricating oil treatment.

This text describes the evolution of centrifuge separators and clarifiers used in oil treatment, focusing on automatic self-cleaning mechanisms.  Early models required manual cleaning, but advancements led to hydraulically-actuated systems that allowed for quick cleaning without stopping the machine.  Modern ships utilize electronic timing and sensors to automate the cleaning process, triggered either by a pre-set schedule or by detecting water in the output.  This automation enables unmanned engine room operation.

This text describes a centrifugal separator for purifying fuel and lubricating oils.  The separator's main component is a cylindrical bowl with a conical bottom, spinning on a vertical spindle driven by a motor.  Oil enters through a distributor, and impurities are separated by centrifugal force, discharged over a dam ring or specific gravity plug.  The bowl's design ensures proper balance and sealing.  The unit includes a frame housing bearings, gearing (lubricated by splash), and a forced lubrication system for the bearings.

This text describes the operation of a centrifugal purifier for fuel oil, used in older diesel ships.  The purifier uses a bowl with conical partitions to separate oil from water, sludge, and solids based on centrifugal force.  Before purification, fuel is stored, transferred using pumps, and heated to reduce viscosity.  The purification process involves settling tanks to allow initial separation, followed by centrifugal separation using two separators and a clarifier, ensuring continuous cleaning and maximizing impurity removal.

This text describes a two-stage fuel purification system for marine engines.  Fuel is first processed in a separator (purifier) using centrifugal force to remove water, sludge, and solids.  Then, it goes through a clarifier (second centrifuge) for further solid removal.  The purified fuel is stored, heated to the correct viscosity, filtered, and then supplied to the engine.  The system includes settling tanks, heaters, pumps, and filters.  Note that soluble impurities remain in the fuel.  The text also briefly mentions adaptations needed for handling high-viscosity, high-density, high-carbon fuels, stating that the equipment is similar to older systems but with unspecified modifications.

To prevent catastrophic engine failure due to poor fuel quality, especially with reduced engine room staffing, the text recommends several improvements to marine diesel fuel systems.  These include fully automated and monitored fuel cleaning systems with fail-safes, improved insulation and heating of fuel storage and piping,  separately driven pumps for each fuel separator, and the use of modern centrifugal fuel cleaning equipment that can operate without internal water seals.  Control of the cleaning process should be automated, ideally using a computer to monitor water content and trigger cleaning cycles based on pre-programmed parameters.  The maximum preheating temperature for fuel is limited to approximately 98°C to avoid water boiling.

This text describes the automatic water removal process in a centrifugal fuel purifier.  A sensor monitors water content in the clean fuel. If water is detected prematurely or a rapid drop in water content occurs, a valve opens, discharging water.  The system also monitors water content in the dirty fuel; if it exceeds the purifier's capacity, alarms activate, and the contaminated fuel is bypassed.  The purifier operates on a fixed time interval for cleaning cycles, regardless of water content fluctuations within those cycles.  Water accumulating in the bowl is discharged during the cleaning cycle.

To effectively clean high-density fuel oils in centrifugal separators, the sealing water must be denser than the fuel at operating temperature.  If not, a denser sealing liquid (e.g., salt water) must be used.  Careful material selection is crucial to prevent corrosion, requiring potential use of corrosion inhibitors.  The spent sealing liquid and water can be recycled after testing.  Pre-heating fuel and lubricating oils reduces viscosity, improving flow and reducing pumping loads in the separator, and increases the difference in specific gravity between the oil, water, and solids, enhancing separation.

This text discusses the separation of oil, water, and solids in mixtures, focusing on the impact of temperature and centrifugal separation.  Heating increases the specific gravity difference between oil and water, improving separation efficiency in settling tanks and centrifugal separators. Centrifugal separators are more effective but require preheating.  The text also differentiates between strainers (full-flow, suction-side protection) and filters (full-flow or bypass, discharge-side filtration), and describes simplex, duplex, bypass, and full-flow filter types.  Finally, it briefly mentions obtaining fuel with a specific viscosity and potential difficulties associated with its use (though the specifics of these difficulties are not detailed).

This text discusses fuel oil blending and potential problems in marine diesel engines.  High-viscosity fuel, a blend of distillate and residual oils, requires careful proportioning to achieve the correct viscosity. Incompatible fuel blends can cause precipitation, clogging purifiers. Mixing fuels from different sources aboard ship is discouraged. Oil-water emulsions can form in fuel tanks or crankcases, causing operational difficulties, but additives can help break them down. Grease, a lubricating material, is used in various applications, including bearings.  Finally, the text notes the possibility of receiving bad fuel oil, leading to engine problems, but doesn't quantify the probability.

While the likelihood of receiving severely contaminated fuel is low, the consequences are severe.  Ship owners should utilize readily available fuel testing services (offered by classification societies and commercial entities) either through off-ship laboratory analysis or onboard testing kits.  Choosing the cheapest fuel without technical consultation has proven problematic.  Various organizations (e.g., ISO, ASTM, BSI) have established fuel oil quality standards, though adoption isn't universal.

This text describes a fuel injection pump system used in combustion engines.  Each cylinder has a pump with a ram driven by a cam. Fuel delivery is controlled by varying the point in the ram's stroke where a port opens, connecting the pressure and suction sides. This allows for precise fuel metering, rapid pressure build-up for atomization, and quick cut-off to prevent dribbling, even at low engine speeds.  The system incorporates shock absorbers and robust parts to handle high pressures (up to 450 bars). Fuel quantity can also be controlled via a tappet and eccentric shaft connected to a governor or fuel lever, adjusting the suction valve's clearance.

This text describes a marine diesel engine's fuel system.  It details a fuel pump's operation, explaining how fuel is injected into the cylinder and how fuel can be cut off a cylinder without stopping the engine.  It then defines atomization, penetration, and turbulence in the context of fuel combustion, emphasizing their importance for efficient and complete burning.  Finally, it mentions the importance of fuel injection valve design and sprayer hole size, though specifics on the latter are not provided.

This text describes the construction and operation of a fuel injection valve.  The valve body has multiple holes for fuel inlet, priming, and cooling.  A needle valve, held by a spring, controls fuel flow.  The nozzle tip, which may have multiple spray holes, is cooled by circulating coolant.  The valve is opened by a shock wave and oil pressure, and its design minimizes leakage.  Variations exist depending on fuel type and engine speed, including pintle injectors for simpler, less expensive designs.

This text excerpt from a Q&A section on marine diesel engines focuses on fuel injection.  It describes the pintle-type fuel injector, explains why spray coverage is greater during testing than in actual operation (due to air density differences), details the cone-shaped fuel spray pattern, and outlines the pressure build-up required for fuel valve lift and injection.  Pressures ranging from 245 to 1000 bar are mentioned.

This text describes the mechanics of fuel injection in medium-speed engines, focusing on the relationship between injection pressure, system strain, and injection timing.  High injection pressures (up to 1250 bar) cause system components to expand slightly, impacting injection lag (the time delay before injection begins).  Fuel metering can be controlled by a single suction valve, affecting either the start or end of injection depending on the valve's fulcrum point.  Using two suction valves allows control of both the start and end of injection.  Changes in engine load affect injection timing differently depending on which valve controls injection.

This text describes fuel injection pump mechanisms, focusing on how injection timing and fuel quantity are controlled.  Different pump designs are discussed, including those with suction and spill valves, and those using a helical-edged ram (like the Bosch "jerk" pump).  The key control parameters are the relative positions of valves or the ram to the suction and spill ports.  The text also explains the importance of fuel atomization for efficient combustion within the short timeframe available in a diesel engine's cylinder.  Atomization increases surface area, allowing for faster and more complete burning.

Diesel engine combustion occurs in three phases.  Phase one is the ignition delay period, where injected fuel vaporizes and prepares for combustion. Phase two is rapid combustion and pressure rise, starting with self-ignition and marked by a sharp turning point on a pressure-crank displacement diagram. Phase three is a slower pressure rise, ending near the maximum pressure point, coinciding with the end of fuel injection.  The figures show that fuel injection always starts and ends at the same crank angle, regardless of the fuel pump ram's helix direction.

This text discusses diesel engine combustion phases, afterburning, and fuel viscosity.  Three combustion phases are described, with varying fuel injection and heat liberation percentages. Afterburning, extending the third phase, is caused by factors like incorrect fuel grade, poor atomization, and insufficient air.  Afterburning leads to high exhaust temperatures, reduced firing pressure, and thermal inefficiency.  Fuel viscosity increases significantly with pressure, impacting injector operation.  Fuel injectors are designed for a viscosity range of 5-15 cSt for marine diesel oil and similar ranges for heavy fuel oils, with manufacturers specifying maximum viscosity limits.  Overheating fuel can cause fouling.

Operating a diesel engine with high-viscosity fuel at low temperatures leads to poor atomization and penetration, causing afterburning.  This can result in fuel contacting and damaging engine components (pistons, cylinder walls), leading to lubrication failure, increased wear, carbon buildup, ring seizure, and ultimately costly repairs.  Dark exhaust smoke, indicating incomplete combustion, stems from faulty fuel injection equipment (dirty injectors, incorrect settings, leaks) or insufficient air supply (dirty filters, turbocharger issues).

This text describes how to troubleshoot engine smoke in marine diesel engines.  The investigation involves identifying the smoking engine and cylinder(s).  Causes explored include dirty air filters (affecting all cylinders), low fuel temperature (heavy fuel engines),  fouled scavenge ports (two-stroke engines), and faulty fuel valves (individual cylinders).  Diagnosing faulty fuel valves involves checking fuel pump delivery, firing pressures, exhaust temperatures, and the valve itself for leaks and proper spray pattern.  Patterned carbon buildup on fuel valve nozzles is mentioned but not explained.

Carbon buildup ("petal" or "trumpet" formations) on fuel valve nozzles, especially those using high-viscosity fuel, causes poor combustion, smoke, high exhaust temperatures, and increased fuel consumption.  This is primarily due to overheating of fuel in the fuel sac, leading to coking around spray holes.  Operating the fuel-valve cooling system at too high a temperature exacerbates this.  Poor valve closure also contributes. Conversely, too low a cooling temperature causes corrosion.  Fuel valve needles and seats are typically conical (though older designs used flat ends), with the included angle varying between 40° and 70°.  Atomization and penetration during injection result from high pressure fuel passing through the valve, displacing residual fuel in the sac and then injecting a new charge.

This text describes diesel fuel injection, focusing on fuel spray characteristics within an engine's combustion chamber.  Fuel exits the sprayer holes at high velocity, with the outer layers atomizing due to air friction while the central core penetrates further.  Atomization and penetration depend on fuel viscosity.  Spray direction is typically perpendicular to air motion, though variations exist.  Fuel nozzle hole shape and dimensions (length-to-diameter ratio) significantly impact penetration.  Finally, assessing the serviceability of a fuel nozzle involves checking hole diameter against manufacturer specifications after cleaning.

This text details fuel valve maintenance and the operation of fuel priming and surcharge pumps in marine diesel engines.  Fuel valve nozzle condition is assessed visually and by gauge; oversized or damaged nozzles are scrapped. Fuel leakage isn't always cause for scrapping.  Doubtful valves should be tagged and reported.  A fuel priming pump briefly primes the system;  any pressure issues require investigation before restarting. A fuel surcharge pump maintains pressure on high-viscosity fuel to prevent vapor lock, typically running from standby through engine shutdown, but usage varies depending on fuel type and tank head.

This text describes fuel system maintenance procedures.  It covers:  maintaining sufficient fuel temperature to prevent viscosity issues and vapor lock during fuel transfer (mentioning surcharge/booster pumps);  the removal, overhaul, and replacement of large fuel injection valves; and detailed instructions for cleaning, inspecting, testing, and reassembling these valves, emphasizing careful cleaning and proper seating, with notes on lapping and lubrication.

Fuel valve assembly and testing require careful attention to locating pins for spray direction, injection pressure, tightness, lift (potentially adjusted via spacer rings), and spray angle.  Sealing between the pressure and cooling spaces, achieved via lapped surfaces or O-rings (requiring replacement during overhaul), should be checked for leaks by pressurizing the cooling space.

This text details the proper procedures for testing, maintaining, and replacing fuel valves in marine diesel engines.  It emphasizes cleanliness throughout the process, proper tool usage to avoid damage, and careful inspection of all components.  Leak testing, lapping of seating surfaces, and correct tightening torque are crucial to prevent leaks, which can cause false alarms and engine damage.  Post-installation checks and adherence to manufacturer's instructions are also stressed.

This text describes checking maximum cylinder pressures in marine diesel engines.  Methods vary by engine speed, using indicators or piezoelectric transducers.  High maximum pressures cause excessive stress, potentially damaging the crankshaft or bearings. Low pressures increase fuel consumption.  Adjusting fuel pump cam timing (advancing or retarding) increases or decreases maximum cylinder pressure, but the fuel injection quantity remains unchanged.  Precise methods for cam adjustment are detailed.

This text describes two methods for adjusting fuel injection timing in helix and port-control fuel pumps.  The first involves machining a plate to compensate for wear, slightly increasing fuel pressure. The second uses a threaded cage to move the pump barrel axially, adjusting injection timing without changing the injection period.  The text also details how to check maximum firing and compression pressures in propulsion and auxiliary engines, recommending full-load testing where possible, or using engine characteristics and torsion meter data if full load isn't achievable.  Low firing pressures are investigated by checking compression pressures.

This text describes methods for checking the performance of marine diesel engines, primarily focusing on verifying brake horsepower.  Methods involve using a torsion meter or indicator cards to determine horsepower, then comparing this to engine characteristics curves.  The text notes that engine speed varies with load and that multi-engined installations require all engines to be running.  Special considerations are given for controllable-pitch propellers, emphasizing the need for coordination between bridge and engine room controls.  Finally, the text addresses troubleshooting low firing pressures, attributing them to worn parts or low compression pressure, and stresses thorough investigation before adjusting fuel pump settings.

Variable injection timing is a fuel pump control method that maintains maximum cylinder firing pressure from 75% to 100% engine load.  This increases the expansion ratio of combustion gases, improving thermal efficiency and lowering fuel consumption, especially at part loads, by keeping cylinder pressure at its maximum designed value across a wider load range.

This text describes how variable injection timing is achieved in a marine diesel engine.  Injection timing is adjusted by altering the positions of suction and spill valves (controlled mechanically or by computer) on the fuel pump.  This changes when injection starts and ends, without necessarily altering fuel quantity.  The text also explains how turbulence is created in the cylinder, primarily through the angled positioning of scavenge ports to induce air rotation.  Finally, it emphasizes the importance of consulting engine manufacturer instructions for adjustments and regular monitoring of cylinder pressure to protect the crankshaft.

This text discusses engine design and fuel consumption calculations.  It describes how air deflectors improve engine efficiency, explains the "squish" effect in high-speed engines to improve fuel-air mixing, and provides a sample calculation of fuel injected per stroke at different engine speeds (100 rpm and 32 rpm) for a two-stroke, eight-cylinder engine with a given brake horsepower and specific fuel consumption.  The calculation uses the cube law for propeller power to estimate power at the lower speed.

This text presents calculations related to engine brake horsepower and fuel injection, followed by a problem calculating the surface area increase of atomized oil.  The brake horsepower calculation at slow speeds is noted as approximate and susceptible to external factors. The surface area problem demonstrates a significant increase (approximately 287,000 times) in surface area when 100ml of oil is atomized into 20-micron spherical particles.  Discrepancies exist in the calculations presented, particularly in the final surface area calculation which uses inconsistent units and arrives at different results depending on the method used.

This text discusses aspects of marine diesel engine fuel injection.  It covers:  the increased combustion rate achieved by atomizing fuel into small particles; calculating fuel injection velocity and pressure; the economic advantages of using low-cost blended fuel for maneuvering engines; and a description of a system for continuously circulating fuel through injection valves during operation and standby to maintain fuel viscosity.

This text excerpt from "100 Questions and Answers on the Marine Diesel Engine" discusses fuel circulation in marine diesel engines and the effects of fuel quality on combustion.  When the engine is stopped, fuel circulates through the injection valve to maintain temperature and prevent overheating.  High-viscosity, high-carbon fuels cause longer ignition delays, leading to higher cylinder pressures, afterburning, increased wear, and potential engine damage.  The presence of catalytic cracking fines in the fuel can also negatively impact engine components due to increased wear.

Fuel contaminants (3-35 micron particles) cause rapid wear in ship propulsion machinery (5-20+ micron clearances).  Even small amounts of abrasive material (e.g., 0.58 kg/day in a 3500 hp engine) lead to significant wear in fuel injection equipment, cylinder liners, and piston rings, sometimes causing engine failure.  To mitigate this, ship owners should utilize fuel analysis services, avoid mixing old and new fuel, and optimize fuel cleaning using separators and clarifiers at high temperatures and low throughput, potentially with flow controllers for lower-grade fuels.

This text excerpt from a marine diesel engine manual details electronic fuel injection systems, explaining their computer-controlled operation based on various sensor inputs (fuel lever, governor, crank position, etc.) to optimize injection timing and prevent engine damage through monitoring and alarm systems.  It also provides the stoichiometric oxygen requirements for the complete combustion of carbon and hydrogen, specifying the resulting temperatures and heat liberated in each case, highlighting the importance of sufficient air for complete combustion to CO2.

This text discusses the combustion of hydrogen and diesel fuel.  It notes that the heat produced by hydrogen combustion depends on whether the water byproduct is liquid or gaseous.  The average composition of diesel exhaust is given, highlighting the presence of oxygen due to excess air and the formation of harmful nitrogen oxides (NOx).  The text then explores the effects of water in diesel fuel, stating that while seawater contamination causes problems, fresh water, when homogenized, can be tolerated and may even improve fuel efficiency and reduce NOx emissions by enhancing atomization and lowering combustion temperature.

Older, non-supercharged two-stroke engines use either reciprocating pumps (double-acting, with suction and delivery valves) or Roots blowers to supply scavenge air.  Reciprocating pumps, driven by the engine (either via rocking levers or a separate crank and connecting rod), utilize lightweight pistons and valves for efficient air delivery.  To minimize piston speed and increase efficiency, their stroke is typically shorter than the engine's.  Tandem pump arrangements are sometimes used.

Roots blowers are engine-driven superchargers used in marine diesel engines.  They consist of two lobed rotors that mesh without contact, creating a positive displacement to draw in and expel air.  A reversing mechanism, using a butterfly flap, allows for air flow reversal in reversible engines.  Spring-loaded and damper couplings mitigate starting shock and torque variations in larger engines.  Roots blowers are more compact and operate at higher speeds than reciprocating scavenge pumps, but are noisier.

Dirty scavenge ports increase air flow resistance, raising scavenge pump discharge pressure and reducing engine efficiency and increasing fuel consumption.  Modern scavenge pumps use plain pistons (without rings) to minimize air leakage and improve efficiency; rings, while offering better sealing, increase friction and reduce efficiency.  Scavenge pump lubrication is crucial and should be minimized to prevent fouling.  Air/exhaust gas flow through ports depends on pressure difference across the ports, port area, and port entry shape.

This text discusses design aspects of two-stroke cross-scavenged engines.  Older designs had the exhaust port higher than the scavenge port, leading to scavenge air loss into the exhaust and limiting power.  Improvements involved raising the scavenge ports above the exhaust ports and adding non-return valves to prevent this air loss, thus increasing power output.

This text describes loop-scavenged two-stroke engines, focusing on their scavenge valves.  These valves, constructed from thin steel plates and alloy castings, improve air retention during compression, increasing power output by approximately 20% compared to cross-scavenged engines.  The text details the valve's construction, assembly precautions (emphasizing correct orientation to prevent air flow reversal), and its use in both engines and scavenge pumps.  A key challenge with valve-controlled scavenge ports is fouling.

This text discusses two-stroke engine scavenging and exhaust systems.  It explains how oil fouling occurs in scavenge ports and valves, requiring regular cleaning.  It details how pressure charging is achieved in loop-scavenged engines by restricting exhaust gas flow to build manifold pressure, preventing scavenge air loss and utilizing turbo-blowers.  The text also describes tuned exhaust systems, leveraging the vacuum created by one cylinder's exhaust to aid the expulsion of exhaust from subsequent cylinders. Finally, it touches upon the limitations of power output in a diesel engine cylinder, hinting at the consequences of excessive fuel injection.

Diesel engine power is limited by the amount of air available to burn fuel.  Increasing power requires more air intake. This can be achieved by supercharging (using pressurized air) in both two-stroke and four-stroke engines, though some power is lost driving the supercharger.  However, the net power output increases, and in four-stroke engines, supercharging also reduces pumping losses.  Increased cooling and stronger engine parts are necessary to handle the higher temperatures from increased power.

Supercharging or pressure-charging increases engine power by raising the air pressure in the cylinder before the compression stroke.  Modern diesel engines achieve this using exhaust gas to drive a turbocharger (rotary blower), which compresses and delivers more air, allowing for more fuel combustion and increased power.  Boost pressure ratio describes the pressure increase across the turbocharger, while air density ratio reflects the density change due to air compression and temperature rise.  Performance curves often plot these ratios against blower speed.

An exhaust-gas turbo-blower (turbocharger) consists of a single-stage impulse turbine and a centrifugal air blower on a common shaft.  Exhaust gases drive the turbine, which in turn spins the blower.  The system includes air filters, sound-absorbing material, and air guide vanes to optimize airflow and reduce noise.  The casings are circular for ease of manufacture, and the rotor features labyrinth seals to prevent leaks.  A thrust bearing balances the system.

This text discusses turbocharger bearings and exhaust systems in marine diesel engines.  Turbocharger bearings can be sleeve-type, ball, or roller, with the latter two often preferred for simpler cooling and lubrication.  Lubrication methods include using engine oil, a dedicated turbocharger oil system, or individual gear pumps within the end covers.  The rotor requires dynamic balancing.  Constant-pressure exhaust systems use a manifold to even out pressure waves from individual cylinders, while pulse systems (not fully described) are an alternative approach.  The size of the exhaust manifold is crucial for efficient response to engine load changes.

This text describes different turbocharging systems for marine diesel engines.  It details the pulse system, which maximizes exhaust gas energy by carefully timed valve openings and grouped exhaust pipes leading to separate turbine nozzles to prevent backflow.  It then explains quasi-pulse systems, which combine exhaust pipes to improve efficiency and reduce turbocharger size.  Finally, it discusses the "fir-tree" attachment of turbine blades to the rotor, noting that the fit can be tight or loose (with a binding wire for damping in large, high-speed applications) to reduce blade vibration.

This text discusses turbocharger turbine blade fastening, specifically the fir-tree root type, which minimizes stress concentration and improves blade durability.  It also explains how binding wires damp vibrations in high-speed rotors.  Methods for determining the cleanliness of exhaust turbo-blower air filters are described, including visual inspection for small engines and pressure drop measurement for larger ones. Finally, the text details the materials used in air filters, ranging from disposable paper elements in smaller engines to cleanable plastic fiber or metallic wool in larger ones.

This text describes turbo-blower maintenance and operation.  It covers cleaning air filters (using manufacturer-recommended solutions to avoid damage), the effects of dirty filters (reduced air intake, increased exhaust temperature), the need for large lubricant supplies to bearings (due to high-speed friction and heat generation), indications of insufficient lubrication (pressure monitoring, temperature sensors, oil flow indicators, sight glasses), and the principles of two-stage turbocharging (compressing air in two stages with intermediate cooling to reduce work and approach isothermal conditions).

This text discusses aspects of turbocharging in marine diesel engines.  It explains that two-stage turbocharging improves efficiency. Air coolers, typically using seawater, reduce compressed air temperature for better engine performance.  Air cooler fouling, caused by oil (from faulty seals or filters) and moisture, leads to reduced heat transfer, increased pressure drop, and higher air and exhaust temperatures.  Diagnosing fouling involves monitoring temperature and pressure differentials across the cooler.

This text describes troubleshooting and maintenance of marine diesel engine air coolers.  Fouling is indicated by rising scavenge/exhaust temperatures and altered cooling water temperature differences.  Drain cocks check for water leaks and condensation.  Cleaning involves flushing the cooling water and air spaces, with larger coolers sometimes requiring dismantling and bath cleaning.  Care must be taken to avoid damage from cleaning chemicals and ensure thorough rinsing.  Engine manufacturer instructions should always be followed.

Dirty turbine inlet nozzles and blading in exhaust turbo-blowers, caused by unclean combustion (sooty deposits) or clean combustion (sodium and vanadium compounds), lead to increased exhaust gas temperature and reduced turbine speed.  Cleaning methods include water-washing while in service (using a specialized probe) or dismantling for thorough cleaning.  Dismantling involves soaking the rotor in a water bath while regularly turning it.  Alternatively, some turbochargers use walnut shell injection for cleaning.

In centrifugal blowers for diesel engine pressure charging, "surge" refers to an unstable operating region.  A surge line on a performance curve separates stable operation (to the right) from unstable operation (to the left).  Stable operation involves balanced changes in air intake and pressure.  Unstable operation, crossing the surge line, occurs when a reduction in air demand causes a pressure drop, leading to instability.

This text discusses turbo-blower surge in marine diesel engines.  Surge, characterized by violent thuds and pressure fluctuations, is caused by dirty air filters restricting airflow and pressure pulsations from scavenge ports.  Remedying surge involves cleaning air filters and ensuring proper blower-engine matching.  The text also compares impulse and constant-pressure exhaust turbocharging systems, noting the impulse system's efficiency at low loads and the constant-pressure system's simpler exhaust arrangement and higher efficiency at high loads. Finally, it details methods for augmenting air supply at very low engine power, including electrically driven blowers and scavenge pumps.

This text discusses the efficiency of two engine components:  a reciprocating scavenge pump in two-stroke engines and a turbocharger.  In two-stroke engines, a butterfly valve improves efficiency at higher speeds by reducing the pumping load.  Determining the true efficiency of a turbocharger is complex due to its integrated design and the difficulty of instrumentation.  While a simple efficiency formula exists, accurately accounting for all energy forms (kinetic and heat) is challenging.  For practical purposes, the turbocharger's efficiency is approximated by multiplying the individual efficiencies of its turbine and compressor components, and then by the overall mechanical efficiency.

This text describes how to calculate the efficiency of a turbocharger turbine and compressor separately, and then how to use those values to determine overall turbocharger efficiency.  Turbine efficiency is calculated by comparing the actual temperature drop of exhaust gases to the ideal (isentropic) temperature drop.  Compressor efficiency is similarly calculated by comparing the actual temperature rise of compressed air to the ideal isentropic temperature rise.  Finally, these individual efficiencies are used in a formula to calculate the overall turbocharger efficiency.

This text discusses turbocharger efficiency calculations (a simplified method is presented, with a note that a full thermodynamic analysis is beyond the scope of the document) and compares valve timing in naturally aspirated and pressure-charged four-stroke engines.  Pressure-charged engines have significantly longer valve open periods, particularly a much larger overlap period (when both intake and exhaust valves are open), which aids in exhaust gas expulsion and cooling of engine components.  The text emphasizes that valve timing varies across engine makes and with engine speed and supercharging degree.

Modern slow-speed, two-stroke engines use constant-pressure turbocharging, with exhaust valves opening around 45° before bottom dead center (BDC) and closing 80-90° later, while scavenge ports open 35° before BDC and close 35° after.  Modern medium-speed, four-stroke V-engines use impulse pressure-charging, with specific valve timings given for air inlet and exhaust valves.  Emergency operation of turbocharged engines with a disabled turbo-blower involves various methods depending on the duration and type of system (impulse or constant pressure), potentially including locking the rotor, blanking outlets, using a secondary blower, and bypassing exhaust gases.

This text discusses procedures for dealing with disabled turbo-blowers in marine diesel engines, noting that engines with two turbo-blowers can operate at 60-80% power with one disabled.  It then details the positive effects of increased turbocharger efficiency (reduced fuel consumption, later exhaust valve opening, greater work from fuel) and the continued potential for utilizing waste heat (e.g., exhaust gas boilers, turbo-alternators).  Finally, it outlines precautions to minimize thermal stress in highly-rated turbocharged engines, emphasizing monitoring air suction pressure, turbine speed, exhaust temperatures, and cooler efficiency.  Historical examples of waste heat recovery in steam engines are also included.

Regular maintenance is crucial for various engine components.  Gas passage grids, scavenge system valves, and exhaust silencers require cleaning to prevent performance issues and fire hazards.  Turbocharger water jackets, while offering temperature control, are increasingly being omitted by manufacturers due to cost and efficiency concerns, though this necessitates using higher-temperature materials and improved insulation.  Temporary operation with a leaking turbocharger water jacket is possible using thermo-siphon action or forced air cooling, but only with technical department and manufacturer approval.

This text discusses diesel engine construction, focusing on material selection and manufacturing processes.  It details factors influencing material choice (stress, temperature, corrosion, wear, cost), lists ferrous materials used (cast iron, alloy cast irons, nodular cast iron, various steels), and explains the manufacturing processes for different types of cast iron (grey, white, alloy, nodular, Meehanite, malleable) and steel (open-hearth, Bessemer, electric furnace).  A diagram shows an emergency air cooling arrangement for a turbocharger.

The text describes steelmaking processes, focusing on oxygen steel and killed steel production methods.  Killed steel, deoxidized to minimize defects, is preferred for critical forgings.  The text also explains that carbon content directly impacts steel strength and ductility, with impurities further affecting these properties. Finally, it defines heat treatment as a process of heating and cooling metal to alter its properties, listing normalizing, annealing, hardening, and (an unnamed fourth process) as examples.

This text describes various steel heat treatments.  Normalizing refines grain structure via slow air cooling after heating. Annealing, similar but with furnace cooling, refines grain structure, reduces hardness, and increases ductility. Hardening involves rapid cooling after heating, increasing hardness but reducing ductility and causing brittleness. Tempering, applied to hardened steel, controls hardness, strength, and ductility via heating and cooling. Surface hardening improves wear resistance by altering the surface structure, using methods like carburizing, cyaniding, nitriding, flame hardening, and induction hardening.  Diesel engine parts are often surface hardened to resist wear.

This text describes various metalworking processes used in diesel engine manufacturing.  It details surface hardening techniques (nitriding, flame hardening, induction hardening) for components like crankshafts and gears.  It explains the properties and applications of austenitic steels (high-temperature strength) and Stellite (hardness and corrosion resistance for valve components). Finally, it outlines the manufacturing process of large steel parts, emphasizing hot-working (pressing) over hammering for achieving uniform grain structure and improved ductility, and the use of steel castings for crank webs with controlled cooling to minimize internal stresses.

This text discusses materials used in engine construction.  It details heat treatment for crank webs, the composition of cast iron for piston rings (nickel-chromium, with specified percentages of carbon, silicon, sulfur, phosphorus, manganese, nickel, and chromium), non-ferrous metals and alloys used (copper, zinc, tin, aluminum, nickel, chromium, and their various alloys like brass, bronze, and aluminum bronze), anti-friction bearing metals (tin-based and lead-based white metals), and thin-wall bearing alloys (copper, tin, zinc, lead, nickel, manganese).  Finally, it mentions the composition and desired properties (tensile strength, wear resistance) of cast iron for cylinder liners, highlighting the need to minimize impurities.

This text discusses the composition and properties of cast iron and white metal bearing alloys.  Cast iron tensile strength is around 216 MN/m² and can be improved by adding mild steel scrap, chrome, nickel, or vanadium for wear resistance.  White metal, used in bearings, consists of a soft tin matrix (for conformability), hard antimony cubes (for load bearing and wear resistance), and copper (to prevent antimony segregation).  Cadmium improves toughness.  Diesel engine bearings typically have 85-88% tin, 8-10% antimony, and 4-5% copper. Crosshead bearing white metal composition depends heavily on bearing design and operating conditions, requiring tailored formulations based on experience.

This text describes materials used in diesel engines and related equipment.  Section 6.25 details the limited use of plastics (nylon, Perspex, PTFE, phenolic resins) in instruments and electrical fittings. Section 6.26 discusses elastomers (natural rubber, Neoprene, nitrile rubber) used for O-rings, seals, and packings, highlighting their temperature and oil resistance properties. Finally, section 6.27 lists several engineering ceramics (aluminum oxide, silicon carbide, silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, zirconium dioxide).  A table at the beginning shows the composition of a tin-based alloy (88% tin, 8% antimony, 4% copper, trace cadmium).

The text discusses several ceramic materials (Al₂O₃, SiC, SiO₂, Si₃N₄, ZrO₂) and their high-temperature resistance, relevant to diesel engine technology.  It details specific applications for each material, ranging from abrasives and insulators (Al₂O₃) to electronic components (SiC), glass manufacturing (SiO₂), gas turbine components (Si₃N₄), and high-temperature coatings for diesel engines (ZrO₂ to improve efficiency and lifespan).  The use of ceramics in diesel engines is considered a developing field with rapid recent progress.

The text describes plasma flame spraying for ceramic coatings, emphasizing the use of composite materials to enhance properties like strength and shock resistance.  It cautions against using hard abrasives on cyclically stressed materials.  Finally, it lists soft soldering, brazing, and welding (along with adhesive bonding) as methods for joining metals, providing examples of their applications.

This text describes manual electric arc welding of mild steel, detailing the process of joining two pieces using an electrode and electric current (80-100 volts).  The electrode's coating creates gases to stabilize the arc, slag to protect molten metal, and fluxes.  Complete fusion of filler metal and joint sides is crucial.  Gas welding is mentioned for smaller pipework and thin sheet metal, while inert gases (argon/helium) may be used for certain metals.  Adhesives are used for limited applications.  Multiple runs may be needed for thicker metals, sometimes requiring back-gouging and rewelding.

This text describes welding equipment and techniques used on motor ships.  It details common welding equipment (machines, tools, protective gear),  joint types (butt, lap, T, cruciform), and weld characteristics (penetration, reinforcement, throat, root, toe).  Full-penetration butt welds offer the highest fatigue resistance.  Welding positions (downhand, vertical, overhead) are discussed, with downhand being the easiest and overhead the most difficult.

This text discusses various aspects of welding.  It defines undercut (a defect causing stress concentration), describes three ways welded joints can fail (weld metal failure, lack of fusion, and base material failure near the joint), explains joint preparation (edge profiles for butt joints), and details the effects of weld restraint (stress caused by preventing contraction during cooling).  Finally, it outlines methods for preventing or controlling weld distortion, including presetting and using restraints.

This text discusses the material properties and welding considerations for engine construction, specifically bedplates.  High carbon content in steel castings and plates reduces weldability, necessitating limits on carbon content (generally under 0.23%) or special welding techniques.  Welded structures are heat-treated after welding but before machining to refine grain structure, relieve stress, and improve the weld.  Mechanical properties of metals (tensile strength, yield strength, elongation, reduction in area, hardness, shear strength, Young's modulus, modulus of rigidity, and Poisson's ratio) are determined through destructive testing, primarily tensile testing, to ensure material quality and predict behavior under stress.  Tensile strength is specifically calculated by dividing the maximum load on a stress-strain diagram by the original cross-sectional area of the test piece.

This text discusses material testing methods used in engineering, particularly for machinery parts.  It emphasizes the importance of yield point over tensile strength in design.  Ductility is assessed via percentage elongation.  Impact testing (Izod and Charpy methods) evaluates metallurgical properties by measuring the energy required to fracture a notched specimen.  Finally, fatigue resistance is determined by subjecting a sample to cyclical stress until fracture, plotting the results on an S-N diagram to find the fatigue limit.

This text describes material testing methods.  It covers fatigue testing (using magnetic or cantilever methods), creep testing (measuring strain over time under constant load at high temperature to determine safe working stresses for high-temperature applications like turbine blades), and hardness testing (measuring surface resistance to penetration using machines like Vickers, Brinell, and Rockwell, resulting in hardness numbers like BHN or DPH).

The text describes hardness testing methods (Rockwell, Brinell, Vickers) and several non-destructive testing (NDT) methods used in diesel engine component manufacturing and service.  NDT methods include radiography (for weld inspection in pressure vessels), ultrasonic testing (for thickness measurement and defect detection), magnetic particle testing (for surface and near-surface defects in magnetizable materials like engine parts), and eddy current testing (primarily for production line use).  Each method's application and limitations are briefly explained.

This text describes two methods for detecting defects in engine components.  The first uses a coil to detect defects in small ferrous parts by measuring impedance changes. The second, dye penetrant testing, reveals surface cracks by capillary action, drawing dye into cracks which are then revealed by absorbent material.  Finally, it explains how electrical-resistance strain gauges measure stress on engine components by detecting changes in electrical resistance due to deformation, using Hooke's Law and often displayed on an oscilloscope.

This text describes two methods for stress analysis in engine components.  Electric resistance strain gauges measure stress by monitoring changes in electrical resistance,  allowing for both static and dynamic stress analysis (using radio transmission for moving parts). Photoelasticity, using polarized light and transparent models, visualizes stress patterns to determine stress magnitudes, particularly useful for identifying stress concentrations during the design phase.

This text excerpt from "156 Questions and Answers on the Marine Diesel Engine" discusses two aspects of marine engine construction.  First, it briefly mentions that knowledge of stress distribution in parts like bolt heads and shrink fits is derived from photoelasticity experiments. Second, it details the construction of slow-speed diesel engine bedplates.  Two types exist: trestle (supported on stools) and deep box (flat bottom).  Both are typically made of mild steel plates and castings, welded together, though cast iron is used for smaller engines. Fabricated bedplates are lighter and cheaper, while cast iron bedplates offer better vibration damping.  All parts of the bedplate contribute to its longitudinal and transverse strength, often achieved through girder-like structures.

This text discusses the design and construction of engine bedplates, specifically focusing on the evolution of cross girders from fabricated to cast steel.  Cast steel girders are preferred due to improved reliability and reduced welding-related failures seen in fabricated versions.  The text also details how cylinder firing loads are transferred to the bedplate via tie bolts, cylinder beams, and main bearings, explaining the interplay of tensile and compressive forces within the engine structure.

The text describes the structural components and strength members of medium-speed V-engines.  Two main structural forms are detailed: one with a conventional bedplate, cross girders, and a pentagonal cylinder beam; the other with a pentagonal cylinder beam, heavy side plates, and a heavy baseplate.  Strength members vary depending on the design but generally include bedplates, cross girders, cylinder beams, and heavy side/base plates.  The engine's bedplate is further supported by the ship's hull structure, which is reinforced for added longitudinal and transverse strength.  Tie bolts are sometimes used to enhance rigidity.

This text describes the structural aspects of large ship engines, focusing on the engine's mounting and securing.  It details how the engine's bedplate and frame interact with the ship's hull to create a stiff, integrated structure.  The text also explains how to check and tighten tie-bolts, which secure the engine cylinders, using hydraulic jacks and detecting looseness through visual inspection or tactile methods.  Regular inspection, especially during rough weather or power changes, is emphasized to prevent crankshaft misalignment.

This text from a marine diesel engine manual describes the effects of slack tie-bolts.  Slack tie-bolts cause fretting (indicated by reddish powder) on cylinder beam and A-frame surfaces, leading to damaged machined faces and misalignment.  The text also details A-frame construction (welded steel plates, heat treated, machined flanges) and bedplate fastening to the hull using chocks and holding-down bolts for secure support.

This text describes methods for securing a marine diesel engine to its foundation.  "Holding-down bolts" (stud bolts) with reduced-diameter shanks are screwed into tapped holes in the foundation plate, sometimes with sealant to prevent leaks.  Alignment is aided by tapered plates and chocks, acting as wedges, or by casting synthetic resin around the aligned engine.  Slack holding-down bolts can cause noticeable vibration changes or, less obviously, go undetected.

The text describes a chock (a wedge-shaped component, possibly cast iron or steel) used in an engine's foundation.  A diagram (Fig. 7.4) shows its placement on tapered plates.  Loose bolts allow fretting (surface wear) between the chock, bedplate, and foundation plate, potentially causing crankshaft misalignment and serious damage if multiple chocks are affected.

In slow-speed engines where the thrust block is integrated with the engine bedplate, propeller thrust is transmitted through thrust pads to the bedplate, then via holding-down bolts and a foundation plate to the hull.  Fitted bolts around the thrust block casing act as a safeguard against slackening.  Classification societies recommend checking these bolts every four years, but more frequent checks (e.g., every six months) are advised.  Tightness is checked using a hammer test (ineffective for fitted bolts) or a hydraulic jack.  Tightening on modern ships uses hydraulic jacks; older ships may use hammer blows.

This excerpt from a marine diesel engine manual details the procedure for installing and maintaining engine chocks.  It describes how chocks are machined, fitted, and adjusted to ensure proper engine alignment.  The text also addresses troubleshooting a common problem: fretting around slack holding-down bolts.  The solution involves checking crankshaft alignment, smoothing chock surfaces, adding slip liners, and retightening bolts.  If alignment is still unsatisfactory, lifting the bedplate may be necessary.  Finally, the text emphasizes the need for post-repair testing and notes that such repairs are typically temporary.

This text describes the permanent repair of fretted main engine chock landings and chocks.  The process involves removing damaged chocks, lifting the bedplate to its original alignment using wedges and optical alignment equipment, cleaning the surfaces, and creating a mold using rubber strips.  A two-part resin is then poured into the mold to create new chocks, curing for approximately 48 hours.  Finally, wedges are removed, bolts tightened, and crankshaft alignment is checked and corrected if necessary.  The new resin chocks must have a larger supporting area than the originals, calculated based on engine weight and resin characteristics, and approved by the Classification Society.

Resilient chocks dampen engine vibrations, preventing their transmission to the ship's hull.  They're crucial for medium- and high-speed engines.  Holding-down bolts on these chocks (often cork or elastomer between steel plates) are tightened to a specified torque, monitored to avoid affecting crankshaft alignment.  Finally, the crankcase oil pan connects to a double-bottom drain tank via a large-diameter pipe, often incorporating bellows for flexibility, and fitted with a perforated plate to prevent debris from entering the tank.

This text describes the process of installing and maintaining engine chocks on a marine diesel engine.  It details how to initially fit chocks, addressing fretting (wear) issues by smoothing surfaces and using slip liners.  For severe fretting, it outlines procedures for checking crankshaft alignment, potentially lifting the bedplate with wedges, and finally, performing permanent repairs by replacing worn chocks with a resin system to restore proper alignment.  Temporary repairs are considered only to reach a home port.

Fretting corrosion causes bedplate sagging and crankshaft misalignment.  Repair involves lifting the bedplate, cleaning damaged areas, creating a mold with rubber strips, and pouring a resin to replace worn chocks.  After curing, the bedplate is realigned, and crankshaft alignment is checked and corrected if necessary.  The resin chocks must have a larger area than the original cast iron ones.  Finally, crankcase drain leaks, a potential source of oil loss and water contamination, should be checked, especially bellows sections if fitted.  In crosshead engines, cylinder lubricating oil drains into a scavenge space and is collected via a sloped diaphragm and drain connection, preventing it from entering the crankcase.

This text describes various components and maintenance procedures for a large engine, focusing on the piston rod sealing, guide plates, scavenge ports, and cylinder jacket.  It details the materials and cooling methods for guide plates, how scavenge port spaces are formed and sealed, and the inspection and cleaning required for cylinder jackets after liner removal, including addressing corrosion and erosion.  The piston rod packing prevents air and oil leaks between the crankcase and scavenge space.

This text describes the maintenance and repair of cylinder liner seals in marine diesel engines.  It emphasizes the importance of cleaning bell mouth entries and tell-tale holes to prevent leakage.  Proper cleaning and lubrication of O-rings and sealing rings are crucial to avoid damage during installation.  The text also highlights the need to clean oil quill passages and scavenge ports, and cautions against using oil as lubricant for seals.  Finally, it mentions the importance of aligning the cylinder liner using manufacturer markings.

This text discusses the cooling system of marine diesel engine cylinder jackets.  It details how cooling water enters and exits to prevent airlocks, describes methods for inspecting cooling spaces, explains the machining of the cylinder jacket to accommodate the liner (including features like bell mouths), and highlights the importance of proper cylinder head fastening design to avoid stress-related cracking.  The text emphasizes the need for air release connections and proper maintenance to prevent airlocks and ensure efficient cooling.

This text describes the stress on cylinder liners and jackets in engines, focusing on the forces causing bending moments and tensile stresses.  Poor fastening designs (Fig 7.10b) led to failures, prompting design improvements (Figs 7.10c & d) like separating the cylinder jacket from the engine frame.  The text also details the periodic maintenance required for scavenge air spaces and piston-rod packing, emphasizing cleaning oily sediments, checking and adjusting packing clearances and springs, and ensuring proper drainage.  Maintenance frequency varies depending on factors like lubricant use and filter effectiveness.

Figure 7.10 illustrates the evolution of cylinder cover fastening designs in engines.  Older designs (a & b) suffered from cracks due to bending moments created by fastener loads and thermal stresses, leading to failures (b).  Improved designs (c & d) mitigate these issues by repositioning studs (c) and incorporating features like spherical washers to prevent bending moments (d), ultimately improving reliability.

This text describes the arrangement and lubrication of guides and slippers in marine diesel engines.  Modern single-acting engines use guides on columns or A-frames to accommodate crosshead slippers, arranged for standardization regardless of engine direction. Opposed-piston engines have three guides per cylinder unit, each accommodating thrust from different pistons. Lubrication is achieved through oil fed to the guide plates or via connections to crosshead bearings, creating an oil wedge between slippers and guides.  Finally, the text mentions (but doesn't state) the clearance between guides and slippers on a modern single-acting crosshead engine.

This text discusses guide clearances in marine diesel engines.  Guide clearance is minimal when the engine is cold, increases with warming, and slightly decreases during operation.  While some modern engines lack adjustable clearances, monitoring changes under various conditions is beneficial.  The guides themselves accommodate thrust created by the angularity of the connecting rod during operation, preventing engine rocking or vibration. This thrust acts horizontally on the engine frames, varying in magnitude and direction depending on the piston's position (up or down stroke).  The thrust is zero at top and bottom dead center.

In trunk piston engines, the cylinder liner and piston skirt act as guides, replacing the crosshead and slippers found in other engine types.  Side thrust from the connecting rod is transferred to the piston skirt and reacted by the cylinder liner.  Skirt design is crucial for adequate contact area (approximately 90° circumferential arc) to handle these loads.  Modern long-stroke, slow-speed engines feature lighter bedplates and A-frames, but heavier cylinder beams compared to older designs, reflecting improved stress analysis via finite element methods.

Using projected indicator diagrams and inertia force calculations, engineers can determine load ranges and stresses on engine components, leading to more balanced designs, reduced weight, and minimized fatigue failure risk.  This design process is validated through static loading tests with strain gauges on manufactured parts and further testing on engines in service.  A stiffer cylinder beam allows for smaller tie-bolts.

Large diesel engine cylinder liners and cooling water jackets are usually cast separately for four main reasons:  1) to prevent cracking due to differing thermal expansion rates; 2) to allow for liner replacement without replacing the jacket; 3) to reduce defects and residual stresses; and 4) to reduce material costs.  Smaller engines often cast these parts together due to thinner walls and smaller temperature differences.  Cylinder liners must resist internal gas pressure (hoop tensile stress) and thermal stresses caused by temperature gradients across the liner thickness.

Cylinder liners in engines experience cyclic stress due to changing gas pressure, requiring careful design to prevent fatigue failure.  Liners are thinner at the bottom than the top because gas pressure decreases as the piston descends, allowing for reduced material thickness while maintaining strength.  This design also improves heat transfer from the hotter, thicker top section to the cooler, thinner bottom.  Bending moments are created at the top of the liner due to the cylinder cover's clamping force.

This text discusses cylinder liner design and placement in diesel engines.  It details factors limiting cylinder diameter (maximum pressure, liner material strength, heat flow), and temperature limitations on the gas side (preventing oil film breakdown and thermal stress).  The text then explains how cylinder liners are held in place in four-stroke, two-stroke, and opposed-piston engines, highlighting differences in flange design and support structures based on engine type and scavenging method.

Cylinder covers must be carefully tightened to avoid overstressing the cylinder cover studs and cylinder liner.  Over-tightening can cause high stresses leading to liner and cover failure, gas leakage, and engine damage.  Modern engines use hydraulic tightening, requiring regular pressure gauge checks. Older engines use torque wrenches, which also need regular testing for accuracy.  Flame rings protect the cylinder liner from high combustion temperatures.  Increased cylinder diameters are achieved through thicker, perforated liner tops to reduce hoop stress and maintain safe operating temperatures.

This text describes bore cooling in cylinder liners.  Bore cooling involves diagonally drilling cooling water holes to minimize liner weakening and improve heat exchange.  Angled holes create elliptical sections, reducing strength loss compared to vertical holes.  Watertight seals around the liner are achieved using lapped metal-to-metal joints at the top and nitrile rubber rings in grooves at the bottom, ensuring the ring's compression creates a seal.  The groove shape varies, but must ensure sufficient ring compression for a watertight fit.

This text discusses O-ring seals in marine diesel engines, specifically focusing on cylinder liner sealing.  It emphasizes that O-ring grooves must be larger than the rings to prevent volume-binding.  Oversized rings cause installation difficulty and potential liner damage.  Copper rings protect rubber seals from exhaust heat; if these copper rings are worn, they can be recaulked or replaced.  Leaking rubber seals cause minor mess, but in some engines, water ingress can damage the lubricating oil, leading to overheating, corrosion, and bearing wear.

This text provides answers to questions about maintaining large diesel engines.  It covers detecting cylinder liner seal leaks (visual inspection with pressurized cooling spaces), safely lifting pistons (cleaning deposits to prevent ring jamming), and cylinder oil delivery (forced injection via oil quills, with variations in valve placement).  The difference between wet and dry oil quills is also explained.

Wet oil quills, which pass through engine cooling water, present a risk.  A defective joint between the quill and cylinder liner allows cylinder oil to leak into the cooling system. This oil forms insulating films on surfaces, causing overheating, distortion of cylinder liners and covers, and ultimately damage to seals and liners. Repair requires extensive cleaning and potentially machining of cylinder components.

This text discusses issues related to marine diesel engine cylinder liners.  It covers problems caused by water ingress (leading to additive solidification and blockage),  heat-related failures (sealing ring failure and coolant leakage), and wear (primarily at the combustion end due to high temperatures, inefficient lubrication, and ring pressure).  The text also details tools and methods for measuring cylinder liner wear using an internal micrometer and a micrometer locating gauge, emphasizing the importance of accurate measurement at specific points along the liner's length.

This text describes a precise method for measuring cylinder liner bore diameter using a micrometer and locating gauge.  Accuracy is paramount, requiring careful handling, temperature control of both the micrometer and liner (to avoid discrepancies from thermal expansion), and proper extension piece setup.  Measurements are taken at multiple points along the liner's length and circumference.  Results are recorded on a form, comparing current measurements to previous ones to track wear patterns and maximum wear.  Maintaining consistent temperatures is crucial to avoid inaccurate readings suggesting shrinking bores.

The text describes a method for calculating a time-based wear rate.  This rate is determined by dividing the increase in diameter by the corresponding running hours, then multiplying by 1000 to express the wear as diameter increase per thousand running hours.  Two wear rates are calculated: one since the last recording and one since the component was new.

This text discusses cylinder liner wear in engines.  Wear is measured by the increase in cylinder bore diameter, not the amount of material worn away, because wear is uneven.  Factors like ship trim and engine type influence wear patterns. Increased wear at the center or lower end indicates potential piston or crosshead misalignment.  Reboring and bushing worn liners are costly and less effective than replacing them, as rebored liners wear faster due to the softer metal exposed.  Wear is typically greatest at the top, creating a tapered bore.

Worn cylinder liners can be salvaged by chrome plating.  The process involves cleaning, inspection for defects, applying a bonding layer, then chrome plating to build up worn areas and restore a round, parallel shape.  A final surface treatment improves oil retention.  However, the cost-effectiveness compared to a new liner must be carefully considered.

This text discusses cylinder liner wear in marine diesel engines.  It states that maximum allowable wear is typically 1% of the diameter, with liner replacement based on economic factors and ship lifespan.  Wear is graphically plotted against operating hours, but scatter in data points is common due to variations in measurement technique and operating conditions.  While uniform wear is assumed for prediction, actual wear varies significantly between cylinders, influenced by factors like fuel quality.

This text describes a method for determining cylinder liner wear rate.  It assumes a linear relationship between wear and running hours.  Using a least squares linear regression (detailed calculations are shown), the wear rate (m) is calculated from measured wear data.  The resulting equation (wear = m * running hours/1000) predicts wear at any given running time, allowing for estimation of liner lifespan based on a maximum allowable wear.

This text discusses cylinder liner lifespan and copper ring joint maintenance in marine diesel engines.  Based on a calculation (m = 6/0.1223 ≈ 49), the expected liner life is approximately 50,000 hours, or 8 years at 6,000 hours/year.  Companies may establish reserve funds for liner replacement.  The calculation uses linear regression, best performed with calculators or computers.  Copper ring joints require annealing before use or reuse, and appropriate clearances must be maintained to prevent jamming during installation and removal in cylinder covers and valve pockets.  Minimal thickness (seldom exceeding 1.5mm) is recommended for copper rings.  The text also mentions the need for care during overhaul of air inlet, exhaust, and air starting valves, but details are not provided.

This text details the inspection, cleaning, and repair of air inlet valves.  It emphasizes careful examination of all parts for abnormalities, thorough cleaning, lubrication of spindles and guides, removal of grinding ridges, and careful handling of heavy components to prevent damage.

This text details the overhaul and maintenance procedures for various engine components, including cylinder liners, cylinder heads, and valves (exhaust, air inlet, and air starting).  Emphasis is placed on proper lubrication, storage, cleaning (especially removing deposits and scale), and inspection for wear, corrosion, and damage.  Specific checks are outlined for air starting valves, including piston rings, springs, and safety devices like bursting cartridges.  Finally, it briefly discusses two types of exhaust valve designs and their respective pros and cons.

Two exhaust valve designs are compared: a top-mounted design with a gas-tight joint near the cylinder head top, reducing stress and distortion but increasing weight, and a bottom-mounted design which is lighter but requires more frequent overhauls.  The top-mounted design simplifies cylinder head construction and reduces the risk of cracking, although modern foundry techniques minimize this risk regardless of design.  Bottom-mounted valves often have two exit ports for symmetry, preventing distortion and leakage. Large engine exhaust valves are water-cooled because their greater mass slows heat conduction, necessitating accelerated cooling to prevent overheating and damage, especially when burning high-viscosity fuels with corrosive sodium and vanadium content.

This text discusses diagnosing and troubleshooting exhaust valve issues in marine diesel engines.  It describes indications of exhaust valve leakage (high exhaust gas temperature, low compression/maximum pressure on indicator cards),  and methods for confirmation (indicator cards for slow-speed engines, maximum pressure indicators for higher-speed engines).  Causes of exhaust valve burning are listed, including excessive cylinder power, poor fuel combustion, incomplete valve closure (due to various mechanical issues), and insufficient water cooling.

Incorrect exhaust valve hardening can lead to valve seat distortion and leakage.  This leakage causes a positive feedback loop: increased temperature, reduced metal strength, accelerated erosion, and rapid leakage increase.  "Shrouding" is the buildup of ridges on valve seats or valves from repeated grinding, dependent on the relative hardness of the valve and seat materials.

This text discusses valve shrouding in diesel engines. Shrouding, a circumferential step formed around a valve, reduces effective opening area and gas flow.  It's common in smaller engines with non-removable valves and is removed by grinding or replacing valve seat rings.  The text also details the hydraulic and pneumatic actuation of exhaust valves in modern slow-speed engines, including their rotation by exhaust gas flow, and the historical method of valve and seat grinding.

Modern exhaust valves are ground at slightly different angles to create a small gap when cold, which closes at operating temperature due to thermal expansion and combustion pressure.  This design, combined with valve rotation and cooling, extends the time between overhauls (up to 10,000 hours or more).  Hydraulically or pneumatically actuated valves, lacking visible moving parts, can be checked using indicators that track the movement of the actuator piston, reflecting the valve's operation.

This text describes the procedure for fitting a new cylinder liner in a marine diesel engine.  It emphasizes the importance of precise circumferential alignment to match scavenge and exhaust ports.  The process involves aligning scribed marks on the liner and jacket, carefully lowering and securing the liner, and checking for leaks and proper port alignment.  Post-installation checks include hydraulic testing of the cooling space and examination of wet quills for leaks.  The text also notes the historical context of "front" and "back" engine designations.

Diesel engine pistons are made from various materials including cast irons (pearlitic, flake graphite, spheroidal graphite, and alloyed versions), alloy steels, and aluminum alloys. Material selection depends on strength at operating temperature, thermal conductivity, and cost.  Large, slow-speed engines often use steel forgings or castings for strength, while high-speed engines prioritize lightweight aluminum alloys for reduced inertia. Medium-speed engines may use composite designs combining different materials. Annealing is used after forging or casting to relieve internal stresses caused by uneven cooling of different thicknesses.

Pistons are made with concave or convex crowns instead of flat ones to prevent fatigue failure.  Flat surfaces deform under pressure, leading to cyclical stress changes that cause fatigue. Curved surfaces are self-supporting, resisting deformation and reducing fatigue.  The curvature also interacts with fuel injection for optimal combustion.  While some large engines use partially flat crowns supported by brackets, the fundamental principle remains the same:  curved surfaces are superior for withstanding the compressive and tensile stresses (from gas pressure and inertia) experienced during operation.

Piston stresses result from inertia (additive to gas pressure near bottom-dead-center) and thermal differences across the piston's sections.  Larger engines generate more heat during combustion, exceeding the cooling capacity of conduction, radiation, and oil splash.  Internal cooling (oil or water) becomes necessary in larger engines to maintain safe operating temperatures by increasing heat transfer and preventing strength loss and lubrication failure.  Piston crowns and side walls are thicker in uncooled pistons to aid heat dissipation.

The text compares water and lubricating oil as coolants for piston engines.  Water removes heat more efficiently due to its higher specific heat, requiring less volume for equivalent cooling. However, this advantage is offset by the increased complexity and potential for contamination associated with water-cooled systems (separate piping, risk of crankcase oil contamination, drainage needs). Oil-cooled systems are simpler, combining pumps and coolers with the engine's lubrication system, and potentially reducing internal piston stress.  The choice depends on a trade-off between cooling efficiency and system complexity/maintenance.

The text compares piston cooling systems using oil versus water.  Oil cooling offers advantages in preventing crankcase oil contamination and simplifying piping, reducing "hammering" and bubble impingement. However, it requires more power for pumping, uses more lubricating oil, and takes longer to cool down after engine shutdown.  The choice between oil and water cooling is a matter of ongoing debate among engine manufacturers, with simplicity often cited as a key factor favoring oil cooling.

Trunk pistons (or pistons with skirts) in both four-stroke and two-stroke engines reduce engine height and manufacturing costs by transferring connecting rod thrust to the cylinder liner, similar to a crosshead.  In two-stroke engines, they also help seal scavenge and exhaust ports.  However, in highly rated engines, sudden large load increases can cause uneven heating and insufficient contact between the piston skirt and cylinder liner, potentially leading to skirt overheating.

Modern trunk-piston engine designs incorporate several improvements to handle fluctuating loads safely.  These include two-part (composite) pistons with cast alloy steel crowns for strength and heat transfer, and aluminum-silicon alloy skirts for lightness and heat dissipation.  Skirt design features an elliptical barrel shape for optimal liner contact and reduced wear.  Improved fastening methods using long studs, Belleville washers, and locking plates enhance reliability.  Finite element analysis aids in design optimization.  Many engine manufacturers now outsource piston production to specialized firms.

This text discusses piston design in small and large engines.  Small engine pistons are often one-piece, while larger engines may use two-part pistons designed to handle side thrust.  Some pistons, or their skirts, are designed to revolve, either through a ratchet and pawl system or by the skirt's natural movement due to temperature differences, to distribute heat evenly and reduce wear.  Finally, some pistons incorporate wear rings (often bronze alloy) to reduce friction and prevent contact between the hot piston and the cylinder liner.

This text discusses piston wear rings, their function, renewal criteria, and piston/cylinder clearance.  Wear rings minimize trunk distortion in trunk-piston engines and are renewed when flush with the piston or if blow-past occurs.  The portion of the piston above the rings is tapered to accommodate thermal expansion.  Crosshead engines have piston-cylinder clearances of 0.2% (two-stroke) and 0.1% (four-stroke) of the bore diameter, potentially increased with wear rings.  Clearance values for trunk-piston engines are not provided in this excerpt.

Piston clearance in trunk-piston engines depends on factors like operating temperature, piston material (cast iron or aluminum alloy), and cooling method.  Clearances are typically 0.4-0.5% of bore diameter at the top for cast iron pistons, and double that for aluminum.  This clearance decreases towards the bottom of the piston skirt.  The distance from the piston top to the uppermost ring groove is a compromise: it must be far enough to avoid the hottest part of the piston to minimize ring wear, but not so far as to increase piston length, engine height, and reciprocating mass, or create a carbon buildup area.  Optimal lubricant selection and piston cooling are also crucial.

This text discusses internally cooled pistons in marine diesel engines.  It details the purpose of internal piston ribs (heat transfer), coolant flow patterns (ensuring even cooling, especially at low speeds), maintenance requirements for internal piston surfaces (keeping them clean and free of scale/carbon buildup), and the types of cooling systems used (including "cocktail shaker" cooling).  Finally, it briefly mentions piston ring types (though the answer is cut off).

This text describes piston rings in internal combustion engines.  Three main types are detailed: compression rings (preventing gas leakage), oil-control rings (managing lubrication), and oil-spreader rings.  The text discusses different ring cross-sections (e.g., Ramsbottom, eccentric) and methods to achieve uniform pressure against the cylinder wall, including hammering and cam turning, aiming for even pressure distribution to improve performance and longevity.  Eccentric rings, while offering uniform pressure, are not commonly used today.

Piston rings are hammered to create internal compressive stress, preventing distortion during installation.  The force a piston ring exerts on the cylinder wall (wall pressure) varies widely depending on engine bore size and ring type (compression or oil control), being higher for smaller bores.  While directly measuring wall pressure is difficult, the gap-closing force (force needed to close the ring gap) is more easily measured and related to wall pressure.  Piston ring material is typically harder than the cylinder liner material to increase lifespan and reduce wear.

Before fitting new piston rings during a cylinder unit overhaul, meticulously clean all components (piston, rings, rod, liner, ports, combustion chamber).  Remove wear ridges from the liner and piston.  Check new rings for proper fit in their grooves, ensuring adequate radial and vertical clearance.  The ring's working face should not protrude beyond the piston side.  After fitting, verify the ring gap and vertical clearance using a feeler gauge at multiple points.  Failure to perform these checks can lead to ring breakage, liner scuffing, and increased wear, potentially requiring liner replacement.

Proper piston ring installation and maintenance are crucial to prevent engine damage.  Insufficient vertical clearance can cause rings to stick, break, and lead to blow-by, potentially resulting in piston seizure, scavenge fires, and increased wear.  Cylinder unit overhaul should be scheduled based on operating hours or low compression pressure.  Reusing piston rings depends on their wear rate compared to the allowed maximum wear and remaining programmed operating hours; excessive wear necessitates scrapping.  A stuck or worn ring also requires replacement.

This text discusses piston ring inspection and replacement.  Several reasons for replacing piston rings are given (uneven wear, chrome layer wear, excessive clearance).  Due to the labor involved in assessing ring condition, it's generally recommended to replace rings during scheduled overhauls or when a piston is removed outside of a scheduled overhaul.  Replacing only the top two rings suggests the overhaul period might be too short.  Rounded corners in piston ring grooves are crucial to prevent metal fatigue and breakage; ring edges should be similarly rounded for proper fit and to avoid jamming.  Finally, rounded corners on the outer circumference of compression rings are needed for adequate oil lubrication.

The text discusses piston ring clearances and gaps in diesel engines.  Proper radial profile is crucial for lubrication.  Vertical clearance varies depending on ring position and engine size, with upper rings having larger clearances (up to 0.2mm in large, slow-speed engines) than lower rings to accommodate thermal expansion.  Oil control rings have a minimum clearance of 0.0625mm.  Finally, a formula is given to calculate the closed gap of a new piston ring based on cylinder bore (approximately 0.4% of the bore).

This text discusses piston ring maintenance and repair in marine diesel engines.  It covers topics such as recommended clearances and gaps (emphasizing adherence to manufacturer specifications), extending the life of piston ring grooves (through chrome plating and inserts), rectifying piston crown wear (through welding and machining), and the placement and function of oil control rings (scraping oil upwards in crosshead engines).  The text also highlights the cost-effectiveness of repairing pistons compared to replacement.

This text describes piston rod and piston scraper rings in two-stroke crosshead and trunk-piston engines.  In crosshead engines, upper and lower scraper rings on the piston rod prevent oil leakage between the scavenge space and crankcase, with drain holes directing oil either back to the scavenge space or externally.  Different scraper ring types (bevel, hook, double-edge) are detailed.  In trunk-piston engines, scraper rings in the piston skirt manage lubrication, scraping excess oil back to the crankcase via drain holes.  Note that some modern crosshead engines omit a bottom scraper ring in the piston.

This text excerpt from a manual on marine diesel engines discusses piston ring maintenance.  It details different types of oil control rings (illustrated in Fig. 9.5), methods for extending piston ring and cylinder liner life (chromium plating), procedures for reconditioning piston ring grooves (machining to restore vertical clearance), and the causes of piston ring failure (not fully detailed in this excerpt).  The text emphasizes the importance of consistent ring sizing for efficiency and cautions against uneven scraper ring replacements in trunk-piston engines to avoid lubrication issues.

This text discusses causes of piston ring problems in marine diesel engines.  Issues include insufficient clearance (piston rings and grooves), inadequate lubrication (leading to ring sticking), excessive wear (cylinder liners, piston, and ring landing faces), improper ring gap size and preparation, insufficient port radii, and port bar wear.  Scuffing, a type of damage between sliding surfaces, is mentioned but not fully explained.

Scuffing, a type of wear on piston rings and cylinder liners, is caused by localized high pressure breaking down the lubricating oil film between surfaces.  This leads to welding and breaking of surface asperities, resulting in a roughened, darkened surface.  Scuffing is more common in new engines and is exacerbated by factors like overly smooth cylinder liners (poor oil retention), high localized piston ring pressure, and improper lubricant viscosity or additives.  A hardness test can identify scuffed piston rings.

Scuffing in crosshead engines is primarily caused by inadequate lubrication (missing or faulty scraper rings, insufficient oil entry points, lack of oil grooves, defective lubricator).  In two-stroke engines, broken piston rings can lead to blow-past, overheating, and skirt distortion causing scuffing.  Excessive wear in cylinder liners, large piston-cylinder clearances, and worn piston ring landing faces also contribute to wear and ring problems, especially in loop-scavenged engines where gas pressure can bow the rings.  A ring gap that's too small can cause breakage.

This text discusses causes of piston ring and cylinder liner damage in engines.  Incorrect piston ring end preparation (leading to a lack of smooth transition at the gap), inadequate port radii (causing ring shock and breakage), and wear on port bars (reducing lubrication and increasing wear) are highlighted as major issues.  The text also defines scuffing—a lubrication film breakdown leading to surface damage and increased hardness—and explains its causes as high localized pressure and heat generating welds between asperities on the piston ring and cylinder liner.

Scuffing in cylinder liners is most common when components are new, caused by factors like insufficiently textured liner surfaces, high localized piston ring pressure, improper lubricant viscosity or additives, inadequate lubrication systems (scraper rings, oil entry points, grooves), or defective lubricators.  After a break-in period, scuffing is rare except in two-stroke crosshead engines where broken piston rings can cause overheating and distortion.  Preformed piston rings are designed to mitigate thermal stress and prevent breakage in high-performance engines by modifying their radial wall pressure.  Finally, port edge radii are crucial in cross- and loop-scavenged engines to prevent liner wear.

Section 10.1 describes crankshaft manufacturing methods for marine diesel engines.  Small engines use drop forging (up to 4 cylinders) or casting (3+ cylinders). Larger engines use one-piece steel forgings.  Very large, slow-speed engines use steel castings or forgings, with parts assembled via shrink-fitting or welding, followed by final machining.

Section 10.2 defines "fully built" and "semi-built" crankshafts.  A fully built crankshaft has journals, crankpins, and webs made as separate pieces, with webs shrunk onto pins to form assemblies before final machining and alignment.  (The description of "semi-built" is incomplete in the provided text).

This text describes three crankshaft manufacturing methods: built-up, semi-built, and solid-forged.  Built-up crankshafts use separate webs and journals assembled by shrinking. Semi-built crankshafts use a one-piece web assembly shrunk onto journals. Solid-forged crankshafts are created from a single billet, shaped using a hammer or press, then machined to the final form, including heat treatment and final grinding of journals and crankpins for precision and durability.  The text also briefly mentions the importance of "grain flow" (though the explanation is not included in this excerpt).

Steel's crystalline structure influences its strength.  In crankshaft forging, manipulating this grain structure is crucial.  By carefully forging the crankshaft, the grain flow can be aligned to follow the crankshaft's contours, improving fatigue resistance compared to forging it as a solid block where grain runs across the web.  This grain-flow forging involves heating and applying pressure to shape the metal, resulting in a stronger, more durable crankshaft.  Shrink-fitting, where components are slightly undersized, is used for assembly.

This text describes crankshaft manufacturing, focusing on two methods: forging and welding.  Forging involves heating and shaping components (illustrated in Figure 10.1), then shrinking them together and machining to precise tolerances.  Welding, a newer method gaining acceptance, joins pre-forged or cast components using narrow-gap techniques (MIG or SAW) to minimize weld metal and heat input, reducing costs and improving the heat-affected zone.  The choice of component shapes and welding processes depends on crankshaft size and cost considerations.

Narrow gap welding of shafts requires precise setup to maintain consistent gap width.  Concentric shafts rotate, allowing a continuous, spiral weld pass in the downhand position.  The process is automated, with quality checked by visual bead inspection.

Welded crankshafts offer advantages over traditionally assembled ones, including reduced weight, lower cost, and improved grain flow.  Hollow journals and pins require backing rings for alignment during welding, later machined away.  Shrink-fitting in traditional crankshafts creates radial compressive stress on the pin/journal and hoop tensile stress in the web.  Incorrect shrinkage allowance can lead to loose fits (too much) or web fracture (too little).

This text discusses the design and construction of built-up crankshafts.  Shrink fit allowances for pins and journals are typically 1/570 to 1/660 of the diameter.  Web proportions are crucial, with axial thickness generally 0.5 to 0.575 times the pin/journal diameter.  Dowel pins, once common, are now generally prohibited due to their role as stress raisers, as highly accurate shrink fits provide sufficient frictional resistance to prevent slippage during operation.

This text discusses built-up crankshafts, specifically the possibility of slippage between components.  Slippage, usually caused by trapped water or fuel during startup, leads to catastrophic engine damage.  The text details a method to detect slippage using reference marks created during crankshaft assembly.  It also describes a method for repairing a slipped journal in situ, avoiding complete crankshaft removal, by drilling a hole to connect the oil supply to the slipped journal.  Regular inspection and preventative measures, such as checking for trapped fluids before starting, are emphasized.

This text describes a method for repairing a crankshaft journal using cryogenic shrinking.  A hole is drilled in the journal, and liquid nitrogen is used to cool it, causing shrinkage.  Hydraulic jacks apply torque to the adjacent web, allowing for controlled realignment of the journal.  The web is then heated to expand, restoring the shrink fit.  The process is carefully monitored using thermocouples and pressure gauges.  Post-repair, the engine undergoes a trial run before returning to service, with subsequent monitoring of the crankshaft and bearings.  The procedure requires meticulous planning and execution.

The text discusses the challenges of cryogenically cooling a crankshaft journal, emphasizing safety precautions like using inert gases (nitrogen preferred) and preventing explosive vapor formation if using alcohol.  It then analyzes the loads and stresses on a crankshaft during operation, simplifying the analysis by considering a single cylinder and its effect on the crankshaft as a beam supported by main bearings.  The load is determined by piston area and cylinder gas pressure, resulting in compression and tension on the crankpin and journals.

This text analyzes the complex stress patterns on a marine diesel engine crankshaft.  The stresses vary significantly depending on the crank's position (top-dead-center, 90 degrees, bottom-dead-center), with tensile and compressive forces changing magnitude and direction.  Torsional stresses from the driven load are additive, and stresses are further complicated by interactions between adjacent cranks.  Unequal bearing wear or external forces (like hull deflection from cargo or waves) can misalign the crankshaft, dramatically increasing stresses and accelerating bearing wear.

Drilling oil ways in crankshafts reduces fatigue resistance due to stress concentration.  Minimizing this involves strategically placing holes in low-stress areas, smoothing hole surfaces, and radiusing corners.  Alternatively, lubrication can be achieved via crossheads and connecting rods, eliminating the need for crankshaft oil holes.  Crankshafts with bore/stroke ratios near or exceeding unity present design challenges because of reduced web rigidity in a critical diagonal section, increasing the risk of stress concentration and requiring more careful monitoring by the engineer to prevent misalignment.

Before, during, and after removing main bearings and a crankshaft, several examinations are necessary.  Before removal, check bearing nuts, oil pipes, and locking devices. Measure bearing clearance if possible. After removing the upper bearing half, measure lower half wear. Examine the lower bearing for cracks, checking white-metal bonding.  Inspect oil grooves, scraping sharp edges to ensure oil flow. Examine bearing shells for fretting.  On the crankshaft, check journal surfaces for corrosion or pitting, and the area around oil holes for cracks. Inspect crank webs for cracks, especially in high-stress areas. For built-up crankshafts, check shrink fit marks.  Similar examinations apply to thin-walled bearings and solid-forged crankshafts in medium-speed engines, focusing on oil lead-in pockets and fillets.  Carefully examine fillets, especially re-entrant fillets, using a mirror and flashlight if necessary, as cracks often initiate there or at oil hole fillets.

Before replacing the lower bearing half, measure crankshaft sag using a bridge gauge.  The text also mentions a re-entrant fillet and crock locations between arc o-b (likely referring to a crankshaft diagram not included).

This text describes crankshaft failures, focusing on common crack locations (fillets and oil holes), and the process of removing and inspecting main and crankpin bearings in large marine diesel engines.  Bearing removal techniques vary, including using clamps, hydraulic pressure, or jacks, depending on engine size and design.  Inspections involve checking for cracks, wear, and the condition of oil grooves.

This text describes crankshaft inspection and failure analysis.  Inspection involves checking components (crankshaft, connecting rods, etc.) for wear, cracks (especially at stress concentration points like oil holes and fillets), and bolt deformation.  Crankshaft failure typically results from fatigue at stress concentration points due to bending, misalignment, overheating, or torsional vibration.  Improving fatigue resistance involves optimizing crankshaft geometry to reduce stress concentrations.

Fatigue failure in crankshafts starts at points of local damage or flaws under cyclic tensile stress.  Surface treatments like cold working or hardening induce residual compressive stress, reducing fatigue risk.  Methods include rolling and shot peening, creating a compressed surface layer whose depth is crucial and needs testing. Shot peening is used for valve springs and gear teeth, but the surface effect can fade.  Crankshaft treatments require classification society approval, with rolling suitable for various sizes and shot peening best for smaller crankshafts.  The text concludes by noting further study is recommended in relevant engineering materials and fracture mechanics literature.

This text discusses procedures for dealing with a suspected crankshaft crack in a ship's engine.  Confirmation of the crack via inspection is crucial.  For single-screw ships, the crack's depth is assessed; shallow cracks might be ground out, while deep cracks require strengthening before proceeding. A classification society certificate permitting reduced power operation is needed. Twin-screw ships can often proceed on one engine.  The shipowner must be immediately notified; no repairs should begin without their technical department's approval. Temporary repairs depend on the crack's location and available space.  Finally, the text highlights the increased risk of fatigue failure in side-rod crankpin and crosshead bearing bolts of opposed piston engines due to tensile loads from gas pressure and inertia.

Side-rod bolts in engines, especially opposed piston engines, are prone to fatigue failure.  To mitigate this, they have a limited lifespan measured in running hours and require replacement after reaching that limit.  Maintaining equal shim thickness on both sides of crosshead and crankpin bearings is crucial to prevent bolt bending, which reduces fatigue resistance and shortens bolt life. Insufficient tightening also increases stress range, leading to premature fatigue failure.  During surveys, opposed piston engine side-rod bolts require careful inspection for cracks at the fillets and threads, often employing dye-penetrant tests.

This text details the inspection and maintenance of engine bolts, particularly focusing on preventing premature failure.  It emphasizes thorough examination for corrosion, damage, and proper fit, including checking bolt head diameter and using feeler gauges.  For certain high-speed and medium-speed engines, bolt length and strain are monitored to determine service life.  The text also briefly describes the function, location, and drive mechanisms of camshafts, noting their speed relative to the engine crankshaft (half speed for four-stroke, same speed for two-stroke engines).  Finally, it mentions that camshaft torque is not constant.

Camshaft torque fluctuates significantly throughout an engine cycle due to valve and fuel pump operation.  This variation causes fluctuating loads on the camshaft drive, potentially leading to gear chatter and roller chain vibration.  Roller chain lengthening is accommodated by tensioning devices (idler sprockets with adjustable tension), often involving a spring mechanism.  Retensioning can retard camshaft timing, requiring repositioning of the camshaft or individual cams.  Chain transverse vibration is controlled by guides and dampers.

This text describes camshaft and cam mounting methods.  Common methods include interference fits and tapered bores pressurized with oil for precise positioning and angular adjustment.  The importance of proper roller clearance on valve cams is emphasized, as insufficient clearance leads to valve damage.  When adjusting clearances on engines with hydraulic push rod loaders, the oil supply must be shut off and the loaders drained to prevent interference.

This text discusses maintenance and inspection of diesel engine components.  Section 10.39 details the examination of two-piece camshaft gearwheels, emphasizing the need to compare wear patterns on either side of the joint to detect loosening and potential fatigue cracks. Section 10.40 describes camshaft bearing types (journal, roller, needle-roller) and stresses the importance of regular inspection of bearing fastenings and locking devices to prevent timing issues and camshaft failure. Finally, section 10.41 explains the difference in connecting rod cross-sections (round for slow-speed, I or rectangular for medium/high-speed engines), attributing it to load considerations and manufacturing costs.

Connecting rod design considers it as a pin-jointed strut under lateral inertia loading and end thrust.  Loads originate from gas pressure and inertia of reciprocating parts.  Slow-speed engines use round rods, while medium- and high-speed engines require stronger rectangular or I-section rods to withstand higher transverse inertia loads.  Failures are rare in slow-speed engines but can involve fracture, cracking, or buckling, particularly in medium- and high-speed engines due to fatigue from stress ranges and bearing seizure.  V-engines transmit piston loads via connecting rods, sometimes using articulated (master and slave) rods or forked rods to manage the forces efficiently.

Highly-rated medium-speed engines have modified connecting rod bottom ends due to failure issues.  Modifications include a three-piece, wide-angled wedge design with serrated mating surfaces and hydraulically tightened bolts, creating a stiffer bearing housing that reduces stress, fretting, and bearing distortion.  Some designs angle the bottom-end bolts or the split in the connecting rod for easier piston removal.  Clearances in slow-speed bearings are measured with feeler gauges (top-end) or lead wire (bottom-end for better accuracy).  In opposed piston engines, precise side-rod crosshead bearing clearances are critical (though the text doesn't explain why).

Maintaining equal crosshead bearing clearances is crucial in engines to prevent uneven loading, bending moments on tie-rods, fatigue cracks, and uneven wear.  Unequal clearances lead to problems in both side-rod and piston components.  While some designs like the 'single top end' minimize issues, maintaining similar clearances remains vital.  Bearing clearance checks are conveniently performed during piston removal, using a dial gauge to measure the lift between the connecting rod and crankpin.

This text describes methods for checking bearing clearances in marine diesel engines, particularly focusing on crosshead pin bearings in large, slow-speed engines.  High gas pressure causes pin deflection, which is accommodated in modern engines through stiff pins and thin-walled bearings. Older designs used semi-elliptical hollows in the bearing's lower half to manage pin deflection and lubrication under varying loads, achieved through machining techniques involving shims or liners.

Crosshead bearing failures in white-metal linings are summarized as follows:  Failures can be minor (requiring repair) or major (requiring remetalling).  Types of failure include cracking, fatigue, squeezing (blocking oil grooves/holes), overheating (melting), and corrosion.  Causes are varied and require individual assessment, but may include issues arising during initial operation or after prolonged service.

Crosshead bearing damage in slow-speed propulsion engines can result from several factors: misaligned engine running gear, deteriorated crosshead pins, poor white-metal quality, insufficient or impure lubricant (including water contamination), excessive firing pressure, and bearing locking/binding in opposed piston engines.  Maneuvering with diesel fuel in engines designed for higher-viscosity fuels can cause excessive combustion pressure, exceeding design limits and damaging bearings if not carefully monitored.  This is especially true when bridge control is used, requiring the Master to be aware of safe operating speeds on diesel fuel.  Cylinder relief valves can indicate excessive pressure, but malfunctions could lead to unnoticed damage.

This text discusses assessing the serviceability of cracked crosshead bearings.  If the white metal is cracked but bonded, the bearing may be usable if the cracks are small and localized.  However, if white metal is loose, its impact on oil flow must be considered; loose metal near oil holes should be removed.  If significant white metal is lost, or doubt remains, the bearing should be replaced.  Alternatively, engine load can be reduced, but replacement is preferred unless keeping the ship operational is critical.  Finally, the text describes the high-quality surface finishing process for crosshead pins, involving grinding and potentially superfinishing with hones.

This text describes the surface finish of crosshead pins, emphasizing the difference between ground and super-finished surfaces.  Ground pins show circumferential marks, while super-finished pins exhibit wavy lines.  Surface finish is measured using specialized instruments to determine roughness and waviness (form error), but in the field, a comparator with surfaces of known roughness is often used for tactile comparison.  Super-finished surfaces have approximately double the load-carrying capacity of finely ground surfaces.  Maintaining the surface finish of crosshead pins is crucial for their function, as damage necessitates refinishing.  Various standards (e.g., from BSI, ANSI, ISO) define terminology and measurement methods;  terms like AA, CLA, and Ra are equivalent.

The text details the proper storage and maintenance of precision pins, emphasizing protection from rust and damage.  It outlines procedures for cleaning and repairing minor rust damage.  Separately, it discusses improvements in modern two-stroke engine shafting design, including relocating the camshaft drive to shorten engine length and eliminate oil holes in crankshafts to reduce stress and manufacturing costs.

This text describes starting methods for marine diesel engines.  Small engines use manual starting, sometimes aided by decompression devices.  Small-to-medium engines utilize hydraulic starters, involving a hand pump, accumulator, and hydraulic cylinders to engage the crankshaft.  The text also discusses fuel treatment, noting that high-viscosity fuels require heating (up to 98°C) before cleaning in separators or clarifiers. Modern centrifugal fuel cleaning equipment is highlighted for its ability to operate without internal water seals.

A purifier's cleaning cycle is controlled by monitoring water content in the clean fuel.  A water-sensitive device signals a computer to initiate a dump cycle either at regular intervals or when water is detected in the clean fuel.  If water is detected, a valve opens to discharge water through the dirty water line before the regular dump cycle.  The process repeats until the clean fuel is free of water.

Centrifugal fuel purifiers operate on a fixed-interval cleaning cycle, regardless of contamination levels.  A sensor monitors water content in the purified fuel; if the rate of water increase exceeds a threshold, the system bypasses contaminated fuel and activates alarms.  The purifier's bowl is periodically emptied of solids, sludge, and water.  Conductivity monitoring ensures water is diverted to a separate outlet if its concentration is too high.

To effectively clean high-density fuel oils in centrifugal separators, the sealing water must be denser than the fuel at operating temperature.  If not, a denser sealing liquid (e.g., salt water) must be used.  Corrosion inhibitors are needed to protect equipment.  The sealing liquid and removed water can be recycled after testing.  Pre-heating fuel and lubricating oils reduces viscosity, improving flow and reducing pumping loads, and increases the difference in specific gravity between oil, water, and solids, enhancing separation.

This text discusses the separation of oil, water, and solids in mixtures, focusing on the impact of temperature and centrifugal separation.  Heating increases the specific gravity difference between oil and water, improving separation efficiency in settling tanks and centrifugal separators. Centrifugal separators are more effective but require preheating.  The text also differentiates between strainers (full-flow, suction-side) and filters (full-flow or bypass, discharge-side), describing simplex, duplex, bypass, and full-flow filter types and safety precautions.  Finally, it briefly mentions obtaining fuel with a specific viscosity but doesn't detail the process or difficulties.

This text discusses fuel oil blending and potential problems in marine diesel engines.  High-viscosity fuel, a blend of distillate and residual oils, requires careful proportioning to achieve the correct viscosity.  Incompatible fuel blends can cause precipitation, clogging purifiers. Mixing fuels from different sources aboard ship is discouraged. Oil-water emulsions, often forming in fuel tanks or crankcases, can cause operational difficulties but can be treated with additives.  Grease, a lubricating material, is used in various applications, including bearings.  The text concludes by posing a question about the probability of receiving bad fuel oil, without providing an answer.

While the likelihood of receiving severely contaminated fuel is low, the consequences are severe.  Ship owners should utilize readily available fuel testing services (offered by classification societies and commercial entities) either through off-ship laboratory analysis or onboard testing kits.  Choosing the cheapest fuel without technical consultation has proven problematic.  Various organizations (e.g., BSI, CIMAC, ISO, ASTM) have established fuel oil quality standards, though adoption isn't universal.

This text describes a fuel injection pump system used in combustion engines.  Each cylinder has a pump with a ram driven by a cam. Fuel delivery is controlled by varying the point in the ram's stroke where a port opens, connecting the pressure and suction sides. This allows for precise fuel metering, rapid pressure build-up for atomization, and quick cut-off to prevent dribbling, even at low engine speeds.  The system incorporates shock absorbers and robust parts to handle high pressures (up to 450 bars). Fuel quantity can also be controlled via a tappet and eccentric shaft mechanism connected to a governor or fuel lever, adjusting the pump's suction valve clearance.

This text describes a fuel pump mechanism,  how to temporarily disable fuel to a cylinder without stopping the engine, and various diesel engine starting methods.  The fuel pump uses a ram and valves to control fuel injection.  Disabling fuel involves lifting the pump crosshead. Starting methods include electric starters, air turbines, and compressed air, depending on engine speed and type.  Difficulties starting small diesel engines often stem from compression loss (due to valve leakage, piston ring issues, or water ingress) or fuel system problems.

This text describes troubleshooting for diesel engine starting problems and details the components of a compressed air starting system for marine propulsion engines.  Engine starting issues can stem from fuel system leaks, improperly adjusted decompression devices, dirty fuel filters, water in fuel, blocked air pipes, or a closed exhaust outlet.  The compressed air starting system includes air storage tanks, starting air lines, an automatic valve (opened by a pilot valve), a starting air distributor (with valves for each cylinder), and starting air valves in the engine cylinder covers.  The starting air valves are operated by cams on the camshaft, and their operation is detailed.
